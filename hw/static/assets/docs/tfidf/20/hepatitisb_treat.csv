Title,Abstract
Hepatitis B Virus Cure: Targets and Future Therapies.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem. It can cause progressive liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis with end-stage liver disease, and a markedly increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the last two decades, substantial progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis, B. However, HBV is often reactivated after stopping nucloes(t)ide analogues because antivirals alone do not directly target covalently closed circular DNA, which is the template for all viral RNAs. Therefore, although currently available antiviral therapies achieve suppression of HBV replication in the majority of patients, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss and seroconversion is rarely achieved despite long-term antiviral treatment (HBsAg loss of less than 10% in 5 years). Various clinical trials of agents that interrupt the HBV life cycle in hepatocytes have been conducted. Potential treatment strategies and new agents are emerging as HBV cure. A combination of current and new anti-HBV agents may increase the rate of HBsAg seroclearance; thus, optimized regimens must be validated. Here, we review the newly investigated therapeutic compounds and the results of preclinical and/or clinical trials."
Recent news in the treatment of hepatitis B virus-related cryogobulinemic vasculitis.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic virus that causes hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty percent of HBV patients may develop extra-hepatic manifestations, such as polyarthritis nodosa, glomerulonephritis, dermatitis, poly-arthralgia and arthritis, and aplastic anemia. The association of HBV and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV) has been highlighted by several epidemiological investigations. CV can develop in 0.5-4% of HBV infected patients. It has been demonstrated that suppression of HBV replication by nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) effectively induces clinical response in most patients with mild to moderate CV, but low responses are seen in severe CV. Based on this evidence, NAs therapy represents the first line therapeutic option in subjects with mild or moderate HBV related CV. Peg-interferon-Alfa can be an alternative treatment for HBV related CV, but the few studies published so far have shown no encouraging results. In patients with severe vasculitis and/or skin ulcers, peripheral neuropathy and glomerulonephritis treatment with rituximab (RTX) and NAs should be considered as a first line treatment. The long-term administration of low-medium glucocorticoid doses has been widely used in few studies to control clinical symptoms, but it should be used as a second option, when RTX is ineffective or not tolerated and in association with NAs. This review focuses on novel treatments for HBV related CV."
Estimating the proportion of people with chronic hepatitis B virus infection eligible for hepatitis B antiviral treatment worldwide: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In 2016, of the estimated 257 million people living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide, only a small proportion was diagnosed and treated. The insufficiency of information on the proportion of people infected with HBV who are eligible for treatment limits the interpretation of global treatment coverage. We aimed to estimate the proportion of people with chronic HBV infection who were eligible for antiviral treatment worldwide, based on the WHO 2015 guidelines. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases from Jan 1, 2007, to Jan 31, 2018, for studies describing HBsAg-positive people in the population or health-care facilities. We extracted information from published studies using a standardised form to estimate the frequency of cirrhosis, abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBV DNA exceeding 2000 IU/mL or 20 000 IU/mL, presence of HBeAg, and eligibility for treatment as per WHO and other guidelines as reported in the studies. We pooled proportions through meta-analysis with random effects. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020132345. FINDINGS: Of the 13 497 studies, 162 were eligible and included in our analysis. These studies included 145 789 participants. The pooled estimate of the proportion of cirrhosis was 9% (95% CI 8-10), ranging from 6% (4-8) in community settings to 10% (9-11) in clinic settings. Examining the proportion of participants who had characteristics used to determine eligibility in the WHO guidelines, 1750 (10.1%) of 17 394 had HBV DNA exceeding 20 000 IU/mL, and 20 425 (30.8%) of 66 235 had ALT above the upper limit of normal. 32 studies reported eligibility for treatment according to WHO or any other guidelines, with a pooled estimate of eligibility at 19% (95% CI 18-20), ranging from 12% (6-18) for studies in community settings to 25% (19-30) in clinic settings. INTERPRETATION: Many studies described people with HBV infection, but few reported information in a way that allowed assessment of eligibility for treatment. Although about one in ten of the 257 million people with HBV infection (26 million) might be in urgent need of treatment because of cirrhosis, a larger proportion (12-25%) is eligible for treatment in accordance with different guidelines. Future studies describing people with HBV infection should report on treatment eligibility, according to broadly agreed definitions. FUNDING: WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
Hepatitis B Virus: From Diagnosis to Treatment.,"Hepatitis B infection is still a global concern progressing as acute-chronic hepatitis, severe liver failure, and death. The infection is most widely transmitted from the infected mother to a child, with infected blood and body fluids. Pregnant women, adolescents, and all adults at high risk of chronic infection are recommended to be screened for hepatitis B infection. The initial analysis includes serological tests that allow differentiation of acute and chronic hepatitis. Molecular assays performed provide detection and quantification of viral DNA, genotyping, drug resistance, and precore/core mutation analysis to confirm infection and monitor disease progression in chronic hepatitis B patients. All patients with chronic hepatitis B should be treated with antiviral medications and regularly monitored for efficient treatment. The current treatment is based on nucleos(t)ide analogs and pegylated interferons that save lives by decreasing liver cancer death, liver transplant, slow or reverse the progression of liver disease as well as the virus infectivity."
miRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Viral Hepatitis B and C.,"Around 257 million people are living with hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection and 71 million with hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection. Both HBV and HCV infections can lead to liver complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To take care of these chronically infected patients, one strategy is to diagnose the early stage of fibrosis in order to treat them as soon as possible to decrease the risk of HCC development. microRNAs (or miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which regulate many cellular processes in metazoans. Their expressions were frequently modulated by up- or down-regulation during fibrosis progression. In the serum of patients with HBV chronic infection (CHB), miR-122 and miR-185 expressions are increased, while miR-29, -143, -21 and miR-223 expressions are decreased during fibrosis progression. In the serum of patients with HCV chronic infection (CHC), miR-143 and miR-223 expressions are increased, while miR-122 expression is decreased during fibrosis progression. This review aims to summarize current knowledge of principal miRNAs modulation involved in fibrosis progression during chronic hepatitis B/C infections. Furthermore, we also discuss the potential use of miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose fibrosis with the intention of prioritizing patients with advanced fibrosis for treatment and surveillance."
Characterization of Hepatitis B Precore/Core-Related Antigens.,"Current therapies rarely cure chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection due to the persistence of the viral episome, the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), in hepatocytes. The hepatitis B virus core-related antigen (HBcrAg), a mixture of the viral precore/core gene products, has emerged as one potential marker to monitor the levels and activities of intrahepatic cccDNA. In this study, a comprehensive characterization of precore/core gene products revealed that HBcrAg components included the classical hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBc) and e antigen (HBeAg) and, additionally, the precore-related antigen, PreC, retaining the N-terminal signal peptide. Both HBeAg and PreC antigens displayed heterogeneous proteolytic processing at their C termini resulting in multiple species, which varied with viral genotypes. HBeAg was the predominant form of HBcrAg in HBeAg-positive patients. Positive correlations were found between HBcrAg and PreC, between HBcrAg and HBeAg, and between PreC and HBeAg but not between HBcrAg and HBc. Serum HBeAg and PreC shared similar buoyant density and size distributions, and both displayed density and size heterogeneity. HBc, but not HBeAg or PreC antigen, was found as the main component of capsids in DNA-containing or empty virions. Neither HBeAg nor PreC protein was able to form capsids in cells or in vitro under physiological conditions. In conclusion, our study provides important new quantitative information on levels of each component of precore/core gene products as well as their biochemical and biophysical characteristics, implying that each component may have distinct functions and applications in reflecting intrahepatic viral activities.IMPORTANCE Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection afflicts approximately 257 million people, who are at high risk of progressing to chronic liver diseases, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies rarely achieve cure of HBV infection due to the persistence of the HBV episome, the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes. Peripheral markers of cccDNA levels and transcriptional activities are urgently required to guide antiviral therapy and drug development. Serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is one such emerging peripheral marker. We have characterized the components of HBcrAg in HBV-infected patients as well as in cell cultures. Our results provide important new quantitative information on levels of each HBcrAg component, as well as their biochemical and biophysical characteristics. Our findings suggest that each HBcrAg component may have distinct functions and applications in reflecting intrahepatic viral activities."
Viral Hepatitis in pregnancy.,"The global prevalence of viral hepatitis is very high and seems to be rising over the years. The infection can profoundly affect pregnant women causing significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality with some strains much worse than others. Hepatitis A (HAV) and E (HEV) which are transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route present as acute hepatitis during pregnancy and are responsible for most local epidemic outbreaks. HAV infection remains self-limiting during pregnancy, while HEV has a higher prevalence and causes significant morbidity. It is also associated with a very high maternal mortality rate (20 %) and requires special attention in endemic areas. HEV vaccines do exist, but the WHO has yet to approve them for general use. Hepatitis B is the most prevalent form and is part of the ante-natal screening program. The presence of HBeAg is associated with high viral loads and infectivity. Antiviral therapy, preferably tenofovir (TDF), is recommended for mothers with viral load >/= 200,000 IU/mL2), with the neonates receiving both active and passive immunisations. Hepatitis C and D are usually found as chronic infections in the pregnant and non-pregnant populations. Screening for hepatitis C during pregnancy and its subsequent management is still unsettled, but the introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs will change the picture if their safety is established in pregnancy. HDV is an incomplete virus linked to HBV and cannot establish an infection on its own. Controlling HBV is paramount to controlling HDV. HEV is quite prevalent and looked upon as hepatotropic. It seems to be quite prevalent in some blood donor populations and has a high co-infection rate with HCV. It has a high Mother-to-Child-Transmission (MTCT) but causes little or no illness in infected infants, and antenatal screening is not justified. This review summarises the prevalence, clinical picture, maternal, perinatal effects, and the management and prevention of hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and G viral infections during pregnancy."
Treatment of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most children acquire the infection perinatally or during early childhood and develop a chronic hepatitis characterized by a high viral replication and a low-inflammation phase of infection, with normal or only slightly raised aminotransferases. Although a conservative approach in children is usually recommended, different therapies exist and different therapeutic approaches are possible. The main goals of antiviral treatment for children with chronic HBV infection are to suppress viral replication and to warn the disease progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, although these complications are rare in children. Both United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved interferon alfa-2b for children aged 1 year and older, pegylated interferon alfa-2a and lamivudine for children aged 3 years and older, entecavir for use in children aged 2 years and older, and adefovir for use in those 12 years of age and older. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is approved by EMA for children aged 2 years and older and by US-FDA for treatment in children aged 12 years and older. Finally, EMA has approved the use of tenofovir alafenamide for treatment of children aged 12 years and older or for children weighing more than 35 kg independent of age. This narrative review will provide the framework for summarizing indications to antiviral therapy in the management of chronic HBV infection in children and adolescents."
Effect of combination treatment based on interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues on functional cure of chronic hepatitis B: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Priority of antiviral treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is to increase the probability of functional cure. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the efficacy of different combination strategies of antiviral treatment based on interferon (IFN) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) in adults with CHB. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched from inception to May 26, 2019. Three types of combination strategies were studied: initial combination (IFN or NAs monotherapy as control), add-on (I: IFN add-on NAs vs. NAs; II: NAs add-on IFN vs. IFN), switch-to (I: IFN switch-to NAs vs. IFN; II: NAs switch-to IFN vs. NAs). RESULTS: Compared to NAs monotherapy, initial combination strategy improved the probability of HBeAg loss (RR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.33-1.97) and HBsAg loss (RR: 15.59, 95% CI 3.22-75.49), while compared to IFN monotherapy, no higher rates in the loss of HBsAg or HBeAg for initial combination. Compared to NAs monotherapy, IFN add-on NAs strategy had a higher rate of HBsAg loss (RR: 4.52, 95% CI 1.95-10.47), while compared to IFN monotherapy, NAs add-on IFN had a similar outcome. Compared to NAs monotherapy, NAs switch-to IFN strategy improved HBsAg loss (RR: 12.15, 95% CI 3.99-37.01); while compared to IFN monotherapy, IFN switch-to NAs had no improved rate of HBsAg clearance but higher rates in undetectable HBV DNA, and HBeAg loss. CONCLUSION: IFN add-on NAs, or NAs switched to IFN could significantly improve the probability of HBsAg loss compared to NAs monotherapy."
Hepatitis B virus infection and the risk of cancer among the Chinese population.,"The relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) and nonhepatocellular cancers remains inconclusive. This large case-control study aimed to assess the associations between HBV infection status and multiple cancers. Cases (n = 50 392) and controls (n = 11 361) were consecutively recruited from 2008 to 2016 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Multivariable adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using logistic regression by adjusting age and gender. A meta-analysis based on published studies was also performed to verify the associations. Of these, 12.1% of cases and 5.5% of controls were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive. We observed significant associations between HBsAg seropositivity and esophagus cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 1.32 [1.13-1.54]), stomach cancer (1.46 [1.30-1.65]), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 39.11 [35.08-43.59]), intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma (ICC and ECC; 3.83 [2.58-5.67] and 1.72 [1.28-2.31]), pancreatic cancer (PaC; 1.37 [1.13-1.65]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; 1.88 [1.61-2.20]) and leukemia (11.48 [4.05-32.56]). Additionally, compared to participants with HBsAg-/anti-HBs-/anti-HBc-, participants with HBsAg-/anti-HBs-/anti-HBc+, indicating past HBV-infected, had an increased risk of esophagus cancer (aOR [95% CI] = 1.46 [1.24-1.73]), stomach cancer (1.20 [1.04-1.39]), HCC (4.80 [3.95-5.84]) and leukemia (15.62 [2.05-119.17]). Then the overall meta-analysis also verified that HBsAg seropositivity was significantly associated with stomach cancer (OR [95% CI] = 1.23 [1.14-1.33]), ICC (4.05 [2.78-5.90]), ECC (1.73 [1.30-2.30]), PaC (1.26 [1.09-1.46]), NHL (1.95 [1.55-2.44]) and leukemia (1.54 [1.26-1.88]). In conclusion, both our case-control study and meta-analysis confirmed the significant association of HBsAg seropositivity with stomach cancer, ICC, ECC, PaC, NHL and leukemia. Of note, our findings also suggested that the risk of stomach cancer elevated for people whoever exposed to HBV."
New Therapeutics for Hepatitis B: The Road to Cure.,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection impacts an estimated 257-291 million people globally. The current approach to treatment for chronic HBV infection is complex, reflecting a risk:benefit approach driven by the lack of an effective curative regimen. This complexity and the lack of a durable treatment response, necessitating indefinite treatment in the majority of cases, have resulted in low uptake of testing and treatment, particularly in regions where comprehensive primary care is lacking and access to affordable testing and treatment is limited. Multiple targeted therapies are now in early human study with the primary goal to achieve persistent HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen suppression after a finite course of treatment, which is referred to as functional cure. This article summarizes the current therapies for HBV infection and discusses the limitations of these therapies, novel approaches to HBV cure, and therapeutic endpoints of clinical trials aimed to cure hepatitis B."
"Hepatitis B Core-Related Antigen to Indicate High Viral Load: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 10,397 Individual Participants.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, scale-up of testing and treatment in resource-limited countries is crucial. However, access to nucleic acid testing to quantify HBV DNA, an essential test to examine treatment eligibility, remains severely limited. We assessed the performance of a novel immunoassay, HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), as a low-cost (less than US $15/assay) alternative to nucleic acid testing to indicate clinically important high viremia in chronic HBV patients infected with different genotypes. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through June 27, 2018. Three reviewers independently selected studies measuring HBV DNA and HBcrAg in the same blood samples. We contacted authors to provide individual participant data (IPD). We randomly allocated each IPD to a derivation or validation cohort. We applied optimal HBcrAg cut-off values derived from the derivation set to the validation set to estimate sensitivity/specificity. RESULTS: Of 74 eligible studies, IPD were obtained successfully for 60 studies (81%). Meta-analysis included 5591 IPD without antiviral therapy and 4806 treated with antivirals. In untreated patients, the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimal cut-off values were as follows: 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.94) and 3.6 log U/mL to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater; and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.98) and 5.3 log U/mL for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. In the validation set, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.2% and 84.7% to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater, and 91.8% and 90.5% for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. The performance did not vary by HBV genotypes. In patients treated with anti-HBV therapy the correlation between HBcrAg and HBV DNA was poor. CONCLUSIONS: HBcrAg might be a useful serologic marker to indicate clinically important high viremia in treatment-naive, HBV-infected patients."
Treatment of hepatitis B virus infection in chronic infection with HBeAg-positive adult patients (immunotolerant patients): a systematic review.,"Recently, a controversial approach suggesting the early treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis B ""e"" antigen-positive patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, has been proposed. The objective of this study is to systematically review medical literature regarding treatment of HBV infection in adult chronic infection with HBeAg-positive patients. A systematic review was performed according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Original studies that evaluated the effect of antivirals in adult chronic infection with HBeAg-positive patients were included. The outcomes of interest were viral load suppression, the loss/seroconversion of HBeAg, the loss/seroconversion of hepatitis B surface antigen, and the development of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The search for eligible studies was performed in Excerpta Medica dataBASE, PubMed and Cochrane databases until January 2020, without language or date restriction. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials. Two hundred ninety-six articles were retrieved. After analyzing titles and abstracts, 287 articles were excluded and nine were considered potentially eligible. From these, five were excluded after full-text analysis. Finally, four articles were included. Only two were randomized controlled trials. All studies were carried out in Asian patients. Results were variable with regard to viral load, negativation/seroconversion of HBeAg and HBsAg. One study demonstrated that treated patients developed cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma less frequently than untreated individuals. Overall, the studies were of poor quality. In conclusion, the present systematic review demonstrated that, at present, there is not enough evidence to recommend treating this population of patients."
"Cost-Effectiveness of Testing and Treatment for Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis C Virus Infections: An Analysis by Scenarios, Regions, and Income.","OBJECTIVES: Testing and treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are highly effective, high-impact interventions. This article aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of scaling up these interventions by scenarios, regions, and income groups. METHODS: We modeled costs and impacts of hepatitis elimination in 67 low- and middle-income countries from 2016 to 2030. Costs included testing and treatment commodities, healthcare consultations, and future savings from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas averted. We modeled disease progression to estimate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) by regions and World Bank income groups, according to 3 scenarios: flatline (status quo), progress (testing/treatment according to World Health Organization guidelines), and ambitious (elimination). RESULTS: Compared with no action, current levels of testing and treatment had an ICER of $807/DALY for HBV and -$62/DALY (cost-saving) for HCV. Scaling up to progress scenario, both interventions had ICERs less than the average gross domestic product/capita of countries (HBV: $532/DALY; HCV: $613/DALY). Scaling up from flatline to elimination led to higher ICERs across countries (HBV: $927/DALY; HCV: $2528/DALY, respectively) that remained lower than the average gross domestic product/capita. Sensitivity analysis indicated discount rates and commodity costs were main factors driving results. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up testing and treatment for HBV and HCV infection as per World Health Organization guidelines is a cost-effective intervention. Elimination leads to a much larger impact though ICERs are higher. Price reduction strategies are needed to achieve elimination given the substantial budget impact at current commodity prices."
Abatacept treatment for patients with severe acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus infection-Pilot study.,"Although glucocorticoids have been used for immunosuppression of patients with primary hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection-induced severe hepatitis, the treatment is associated with a high frequency of adverse events. We conducted a pilot study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of abatacept, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA4), for acute hepatitis B. Five patients with severe acute hepatitis B (prothrombin activity </= 60%) were treated for immunosuppression by abatacept. Four patients received abatacept concurrently with methylprednisolone, and another patient was treated with abatacept alone. Rapid decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, increase in prothrombin activity and improvement of general condition were obtained in four out of five patients. The patient with the most severe hepatitis underwent liver transplantation due to exacerbation of hepatitis in spite of treatment with both abatacept and methylprednisolone. None of the patients developed significant adverse events associated with the use of abatacept. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) became negative in all five patients. The effect of abatacept and methylprednisolone for severe hepatitis B was compared using a mouse model. Rapid reduction in mouse serum HBV DNA and human albumin levels and elevation of serum interferon-gamma and granzyme A levels were observed in HBV-infected human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice that were administered human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These hepatocyte injuries were inhibited to a greater extent by abatacept compared to methylprednisolone. Abatacept might be an effective therapy alternative to methylprednisolone to reduce acute massive liver damage for patients with severe acute hepatitis caused by HBV infection."
Efficacy and safety of antiviral prophylaxis during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: To eliminate mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), peripartum antiviral prophylaxis might be required for pregnant women infected with HBV who have a high risk of MTCT despite infant immunoprophylaxis. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of peripartum antiviral prophylaxis to inform the 2020 WHO guidelines. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CENTRAL, CNKI, and Wanfang for randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies of peripartum antiviral prophylaxis versus placebo or no prophylaxis, with no language restriction, published from database inception until March 28, 2019. We used search terms covering HBV, antiviral therapy, and pregnancy. We included studies that enrolled pregnant women with chronic infection with HBV who received antiviral prophylaxis anytime during pregnancy; that included any of the following antivirals: adefovir, emtricitabine, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir alafenamide fumarate, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and that reported the following outcomes: MTCT, indicated by infant HBsAg positivity or HBV DNA positivity, or both, at age 6-12 months, and any infant or maternal adverse events. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Our primary endpoint was MTCT based on infant HBsAg positivity. We assessed pooled odds ratios (ORs) of the efficacy of peripartum antiviral prophylaxis to reduce the risk of MTCT. We assessed safety of prophylaxis by pooling risk differences. The protocol for the systematic review was pre-registered in PROSPERO, CRD42019134614. FINDINGS: Of 7463 articles identified, 595 articles were eligible for full-text review and 129 studies (in 157 articles) were included. The following antivirals were assessed in the meta-analysis: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg (19 studies, with 1092 mothers and 1072 infants), lamivudine 100-150 mg (40 studies, with 2080 mothers and 2007 infants), and telbivudine 600 mg (83 studies, with 6036 mothers and 5971 infants). The pooled ORs for randomised controlled trials were similar, at 0.10 (95% CI 0.03-0.35) for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 0.16 (0.10-0.26) for lamivudine, and 0.14 (0.09-0.21) for telbivudine. The pooled ORs in non-randomised studies were 0.17 (0.10-0.29) for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 0.17 (0.12-0.24) for lamivudine, and 0.09 (0.06-0.12) for telbivudine. We found no increased risk of any infant or maternal safety outcomes after peripartum antiviral prophylaxis. INTERPRETATION: Peripartum antiviral prophylaxis is highly effective at reducing the risk of HBV MTCT. Our findings support the 2020 WHO recommendation of administering antivirals during pregnancy, specifically tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, for the prevention of HBV MTCT.

"The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a myriad of interventions with the urgent aim of reducing the public health impact of this virus. However, a wealth of evidence both from high-income and low-income countries is accruing on the broader consequences of such interventions on economic and public health inequalities, as well as on pre-existing programmes targeting endemic pathogens. We provide an overview of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis B virus (HBV) programmes globally, focusing on the possible consequences for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Ongoing disruptions to infrastructure, supply chains, services and interventions for HBV are likely to contribute disproportionately to the short-term incidence of chronic hepatitis B, providing a long-term source of onward transmission to future generations that threatens progress towards the 2030 elimination goals."
Low risk of hepatitis B reactivation in patients with severe COVID-19 who receive immunosuppressive therapy.,"A significant proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop severe respiratory symptoms due to an excessive immune response. Treatment of this condition may include immunosuppressive therapies, such as IL-6 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids, which pose a risk for patients with active or past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this prospective cohort study, we analysed the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with severe COVID-19 and resolved HBV infection undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. From 15th March to 30th April 2020, 600 patients with severe COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital and treated with immune modulators. Data regarding HBV infection were available in 484, of whom 69 (14%) were HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive. For these patients, HBV reactivation prophylaxis with entecavir was strongly recommended. Complete follow-up was available in 61 patients: 72% were male, median age was 67 years, and anti-HBs was >10 IU/mL in 72%. The immunosuppressive drug most used was tocilizumab (72%). Despite HBV prophylaxis recommendation, 38 (62%) patients received entecavir and 23 (38%) did not. Baseline features of both groups were similar. At follow-up, we found no cases of HBsAg seroreversion and only 2 (3%) patients (no prophylaxis group) had detectable serum HBV-DNA (<15 IU/mL). Both were anti-HBs negative and had normal aminotransferase levels. Our data show that the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with severe COVID-19 and resolved HBV infection undergoing immunosuppressive treatment is low. However, if a systematic follow-up after hospital discharge is unfeasible in patients without anti-HBs, a short course of antiviral prophylaxis may be a safe option."
Assessment and Simplification of Treatment Eligibility Among Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Infection in Vietnam.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment eligibility and the accuracy of its simplified criteria have been poorly documented in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: From a cohort of HBV-infected patients in Vietnam, we assessed the proportion of patients eligible for treatment using the national guidelines based on reference tests (HBV DNA quantification and FibroScan); and the accuracy of simplified treatment criteria free from HBV DNA and FibroScan (Treatment Eligibility in Africa for the Hepatitis B Virus [TREAT-B] score and simplified World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) to select patients for antiviral therapy using the national guidelines as a reference. RESULTS: We analyzed 400 consecutive treatment-naive HBV-monoinfected patients: 49% males, median age 38 years (range, 18-86), 32% hepatitis B e antigen-positive, median HBV DNA 4.8 log10 IU/mL (undetectable -8.4), median FibroScan 5.3 kPa (3.0-67.8), and 25% having significant liver fibrosis including 12% with cirrhosis. Of these, 167 (42%) fulfilled treatment criteria according to national guidelines. Using the national criteria as a reference, the performance of TREAT-B to select patients for treatment was high (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC], 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.87-0.92]) with a sensitivity of 74.3% and a specificity of 88.4%. In a subset of patients with 2 alanine aminotransferase measurements over a 6-month period (n = 89), the AUROC of TREAT-B was significantly higher than that of the simplified WHO criteria (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a large proportion of patients with chronic HBV infection require antiviral therapy in Vietnam. Compared with the simplified WHO criteria free from HBV DNA quantification, TREAT-B is a better alternative to easily indicate treatment eligibility and might help scale up treatment intervention in Vietnam."

"Tenofovir Alafenamide to Prevent Perinatal Hepatitis B Transmission: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study.","BACKGROUND: Few safety and effectiveness results have been published regarding the administration of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) during pregnancy for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: In this multicenter prospective observational study, pregnant women with HBV DNA levels higher than 200 000 IU/mL who received TAF or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) from gestational weeks 24-35 to delivery were 1:1 enrolled and followed until postpartum month 6. Infants received immunoprophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the safety of mothers and infants. The secondary endpoint was the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive rate at 7 months for infants. RESULTS: In total, 116 and 116 mothers were enrolled, and 117 and 116 infants were born, in the TAF and TDF groups, respectively. TAF was well tolerated during a mean treatment duration of 11.0 weeks. The most common maternal adverse event was nausea (19.0%). One (0.9%), 3 (2.6%), and 9 (7.8%) mothers had abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels at delivery and at postpartum months 3 and 6, respectively. The TDF group had safety profiles that were comparable to those of the TAF group. No infants had birth defects in either group. The infants' physical and neurological development at birth and at 7 months in the TAF group were comparable with those in the TDF group. The HBsAg positive rate was 0% at 7 months in all 233 infants. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral prophylaxis with TAF was determined to be generally safe for both mothers and infants and reduced the MTCT rate to 0%."
Tenofovir Versus Entecavir on Recurrence of Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Surgical Resection.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies have suggested that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment is associated with a significantly lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence when compared with entecavir (ETV) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We aimed to compare HCC recurrence and survival of patients treated with TDF or ETV after surgical resection for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This historical cohort study included 1,695 consecutive patients treated with ETV (n = 813) or TDF (n = 882) after curative-intent hepatectomy for HBV-related HCC of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A in Korea between 2010 and 2018. HCC recurrence and overall survival of patients were compared between ETV and TDF groups by propensity score-matched and multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analyses from the date of hepatectomy for HCC. The mean age of the study patients was 54.8 years, and 1,294 patients (76.3%) were male. During the median follow-up duration of 37.6 months with continued ETV or TDF therapy, 561 (33.1%) patients developed HCC recurrence, 144 (8.4%) died, and 22 (1.3%) received liver transplant. Compared with ETV, TDF therapy was associated with significantly higher recurrence-free (P = 0.02) and overall survival (P = 0.03) rates by propensity score-matched analysis. By multivariable-adjusted analysis, the TDF group was associated with significantly lower rates of HCC recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.98; P = 0.03), and death or transplantation (HR, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.88; P = 0.01). TDF therapy was an independent protective factor for both early (<2 years; HR, 0.79; P = 0.03) and late (>/=2 years; HR, 0.68; P = 0.03) postoperative HCC recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HBV-related HCC, TDF therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC recurrence and better overall patient survival compared with ETV therapy."
"Efficacy of Lenvervimab, a Recombinant Human Immunoglobulin, in Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection.","The mechanism of action of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment is not fully understood. A clinical trial in Japan suggested that HBIG therapy might benefit patients with CHB.(1) Lenvervimab, a recombinant monoclonal HBIG developed by GC Pharma (Yongin, South Korea), has been screened from an anti-HBs-enriched phage-display library cloned from hepatitis B vaccine-boosted human blood cells and was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.(2-4)."
Exosomes in Hepatitis B Virus Transmission and Related Immune Response.,"The chronicity of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection relates to both viral factors and host factors. HBV could result in persistent infection and even serious liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B (CHB), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the HBV vaccine can effectively prevent HBV infection, chronic HBV infection still endangers human health and results in a large social burden. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying the HBV-mediated imbalance of the immune response and persistent infection are not fully understood. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) 40-160 nm in size that are released from many cells and transfer specific functional RNAs, proteins, lipids and viral components from donor to recipient cells. These exosome nanovesicles are associated with various biological processes, such as cellular homeostasis, immune response and cancer progression. Besides, previous studies on exosomes have shown that they take part in viral pathogenicity due to the similarity in structure and function between exosomes and enveloped viruses. Moreover, exosome as a novel immunomodulatory carrier plays a significant role in viral immunology. In this review, we focus on the latest progress in understanding the role of exosomes in HBV transmission as well as their vital roles in immune regulation during HBV infection. Furthermore, we discuss the potential clinical applications of exosomes in hepatitis B infection, including the use of exosomes in the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B."
Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C in Adolescent Patients With Positive HBsAg or With Occult Hepatitis B: Is the Risk of Hepatitis B Reactivation Significant?,"BACKGROUND: Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients treated for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) with direct-acting antiviral agents has emerged recently as an important safety issue; however, it has not been adequately studied in pediatric age groups. We aimed to evaluate this risk in adolescent patients infected with chronic HCV and positive for HBsAg and HBcAbs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifteen adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years of age, infected with chronic HCV and positive for HBcAbs with or without HBsAg were included in this study. All patients were treated with 1 tablet daily of the fixed-dose combination sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for 12 weeks. Patients were closely monitored throughout the study for virus load, liver functions, and other safety and efficacy outcome measures. RESULTS: The sustained virologic response 12 (SVR12) rates were 96.7% (95% confidence interval: 88.6-99.1%) in HBsAg positive group and 98.2% (95% confidence interval: 90.4-99.7%) in HBsAg negative with HBcAbs positive group. Throughout the treatment period and the 12 weeks follow-up after treatment, there has been no single case in both HBsAg negative or positive that showed any manifestation of reactivation of hepatitis B, detected levels of HBV-DNA, or deterioration of liver functions. CONCLUSION: No HBV reactivation was observed in adolescents treated for chronic HCV with direct-acting antiviral agents in our study, in both HBsAg positive or occult hepatitis B. Although results are reassuring, we still recommend close monitoring of liver functions to not miss even rare cases of such a potentially serious condition."
"Splenic marginal zone lymphoma associated with hepatitis B virus infection, remission after viral treatment, and splenectomy: A case report and review of the literature.","We report the case of a patient diagnosed with a splenic marginal zone lymphoma with a simultaneous finding of hepatitis B virus infection, who responded to antiviral treatment and splenectomy. We highlighted this association described in the literature and its possible causal role, as well as the available therapeutic choices."
Safe and successful treatment of refractory polyarteritis nodosa with tocilizumab in a patient with past hepatitis B virus infection: a case-based review.,"Polyarteritis nodosa is a primary systemic necrotizing vasculitis whose evolution follows, in many cases, a chronic remitting-recurrent course with refractoriness to conventional immunosuppressants. We report here the clinical case of a 75-year-old patient with serologies suggestive of past hepatitis B virus infection who presented a flare of polyarteritis nodosa with great secondary functional impairment. She had not responded to several previous immunosuppressants and required high doses of glucocorticoids to control the flare. After the initiation of biological therapy with tocilizumab, the patient experienced a rapid and marked clinical and analytical improvement, going into clinical remission and being able to remarkably lower the corticosteroid dose and stop the rest of the immunosuppressants. There was no evidence of hepatitis B virus reactivation or changes in the titers of any of the parameters related to the aforementioned infection. This clinical case represents the first case reported in the literature about the successful and safe treatment of polyarteritis nodosa with tocilizumab in a patient with serologies suggestive of past hepatitis B virus infection."
Management of hepatitis B virus infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppressive treatment.,"Hepatitis B remains a significant global clinical problem, despite the implementation of safe and effective vaccination programs. The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) largely follows the regional epidemiologic status. Serological screening with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) and core (anti-HBc) proteins is a key element in the management of IBD patients and, ideally, should be performed at IBD diagnosis. Stratification of individual cases should be done according to the serologic profile and the IBD-specific treatment, with particular emphasis in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens. In patients who have not contracted HBV, vaccination is indicated to accomplish protective immunity. Vaccination in immunosuppressed patients, however, is a challenging issue and several strategies for primary and revaccination have been proposed. The risk of HBV reactivation in patients with IBD should be considered in both HBsAg-positive and HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients, when immunosuppressive therapies are administered. HBV reactivation is preventable via the administration of prophylactic nucleot(s)ide analogues and should be the standard approach in HBsAg-positive patients. HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients represent a non-homogeneous group and bear a significantly lower risk of HBV reactivation. Biochemical, serological and molecular monitoring is currently the recommended approach for anti-HBc patients. Acute HBV infection is rarely reported in IBD patients. In the present review, we outline the problems associated with HBV infection in patients with IBD and present updated evidence for their management."
Pharmacotherapy options for managing hepatitis B in children.,"INTRODUCTION: To eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the first global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis, with particular focus given to hepatitis B and C in 2016. To achieve the reduction of mortality in children, it is indispensable to know which children should be treated and how to treat them. AREA COVERED: In this article, the authors review the antiviral treatment of children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection including antivirals available for children with chronic HBV infection. EXPERT OPINION: The approvals of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) for children have lowered a hurdle to the initiation of antiviral treatment in children. The international guidelines use nearly the same criteria of antiviral treatment for children with chronic HBV infection, but the WHO guidelines provide a cautious stance on the antiviral treatment of children. Not only PEG-IFN but also NAs with a high genetic barrier to drug resistance should be the first-line treatment for children. In settings with limited medical resources, NAs can be the first-line treatment for children. Although the concept of an 'immune-tolerant phase' is challenged, evidence is not sufficient to recommend the treatment of HBeAg-positive immune-tolerant children."
Humanized anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy is safe and effective in lymphoma and leukemia patients with chronic and resolved hepatitis B virus infection.,"Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy is a promising treatment for CD19(+) B-cell malignancies. However, elimination of B cells by anti-CD19 CAR-T cells may lead to the reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and related hepatitis in patients with HBV infection. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T (hCAR-T) therapy in B-cell malignancies with HBV infection. Twenty relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with HBV infection were treated with hCAR-T therapy. Among them, five hepatitis B antigen-positive patients who received antiviral prophylaxis did not develop HBV reactivation, including two patients who received both hCAR-T and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Among 15 patients with resolved HBV infection, two received antiviral prophylaxis, and the other 13 did not experience HBV reactivation without antiviral prophylaxis. One patient with resolved HBV infection experienced HBV reactivation 6 months after hCAR-T therapy and sequential allo-HSCT. Moreover, HBV infection did not affect in vivo expansion of hCAR-T cells or increase the risk of severe cytokine release syndrome. In conclusion, hCAR-T therapy is safe and effective in DLBCL and ALL patients with chronic and resolved HBV infection under proper antiviral prophylaxis."
Biomarkers for hepatitis B virus replication: an overview and a look to the future.,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health issue but there are no powerful drugs to eradicate the virus. HBV markers including HBsAg, HBcrAg, HBV RNA, HBcAb, and HBV DNA are becoming promising biomarkers to reflect the natural phases of chronic HBV infection and predict the outcome of anti-HBV treatment. AREAS COVERED: The authors summarized the biomarkers of HBV replication and presented the current advances of these biomarkers on predicting the outcome of anti-HBV treatment and identifying the progression of chronic HBV infection. EXPERT OPINION: HBsAg, HBcrAg, HBV RNA, HBcAb, and HBV DNA are noninvasive and feasible biomarkers for monitoring the process of anti-HBV therapy and predicting the progress of HBV infection. However, there are still no strong biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for clinical application. Combination of two or more HBV biomarkers, new technique for measuring HBV cccDNA, and searching novel HBV biomarkers are essential for anti-HBV treatment in the future."
Hepatitis B related dilemmas in the renal unit.,"Testing for hepatitis B in dialysis patients is routine, but newer and more sensitive detection methods mean that there is sometimes confusion around viral loads and occult infection. There are frequently difficult choices surrounding isolation and treatment. Here we describe the use of HBV serology and DNA testing in decisions around patients with end-stage renal disease. We also suggest isolation decisions based on our current understanding of the virus and its infectivity."
"Prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of infections in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 2020 update of the recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO).","To ensure the safety of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT), evidence-based recommendations on infectious complications after HDC/ASCT are given. This guideline not only focuses on patients with haematological malignancies but also addresses the specifics of HDC/ASCT patients with solid tumours or autoimmune disorders. In addition to HBV and HCV, HEV screening is nowadays mandatory prior to ASCT. For patients with HBs antigen and/or anti-HBc antibody positivity, HBV nucleic acid testing is strongly recommended for 6 months after HDC/ASCT or for the duration of a respective maintenance therapy. Prevention of VZV reactivation by vaccination is strongly recommended. Cotrimoxazole for the prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii is supported. Invasive fungal diseases are less frequent after HDC/ASCT, therefore, primary systemic antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended. Data do not support a benefit of protective room ventilation e.g. HEPA filtration. Thus, AGIHO only supports this technique with marginal strength. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is recommended to prevent bacterial infections, although a survival advantage has not been demonstrated."
Viral hepatitis B and C in HIV-exposed South African infants.,"BACKGROUND: Whilst much attention is given to eliminating HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), little has been done to ensure the same for hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission. The introduction of HBV immunization at six weeks of age has reduced HBV horizontal transmission in South Africa. However, in order to eliminate HBV MTCT, further interventions are needed. The risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) MTCT in HIV-infected (HIV+) African women is not yet well described. This study aimed to determine the rate of HBV and HCV vertical transmission in HIV-exposed infants in South Africa. METHODS: Serum samples from infants enrolled in an isoniazid prevention study (P1041) were screened for HBV and HCV serology markers; screening was performed on samples collected at approximately 60 weeks of age of the infants. HBV DNA was quantified in HBsAg positive samples and HBV strains characterized through gene sequencing. All HCV antibody samples with inconclusive results underwent molecular testing. RESULTS: Three of 821 infants were positive for both HBsAg and HBV DNA. All HBV strains belonged to HBV sub-genotype A1. The rtM204I mutation associated with lamivudine resistance was identified in one infant, a second infant harboured the double A1762T/G1764A BCP mutation. Phylogenetic analysis showed clustering between mother and infant viral genomic sequences. Twenty-one of 821 HIV-exposed infants tested had inconclusive HCV antibody results, none were HCV PCR positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that HBV vertical transmission is likely to be occurring in HIV-exposed infants in South Africa.. A more robust strategy of HBV prevention, including birth dose vaccination, is required to eradicate HBV MTCT. HCV infection was not detected."
Harnessing adiposederived stem cells to release specialized secretome for the treatment of hepatitis B.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the function of repairing damaged tissue, which is known to be mediated by the secretome, the collection of secretory materials shed from MSCs. Adjusting the culture conditions of MSCs can lead to a significant difference in the composition of the secretome. It was hypothesized that presensitization of MSCs with specific diseasecausing agents could harness MSCs to release the therapeutic materials specialized for the disease. To validate this hypothesis, the present study aimed to generate a 'diseasespecific secretome' for hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus using hepatitis BX antigen (HBx) as a diseasecausing material. Secretary materials (HBxIS) were collected following the stimulation of adiposederived stem cells (ASCs) with 100fold diluted culture media of AML12 hepatocytes that had been transfected with pcDNAHBx for 24 h. An animal model of hepatitis B was generated by injecting HBx into mice, and the mice were subsequently intravenously administered a control secretome (CS) or HBxIS. Compared with the CS injection, the HBxIS injection significantly reduced the serum levels of interleukin6 and tumor necrosis factoralpha (proinflammatory cytokines). Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry of the liver specimens revealed that the HBxIS injection led to a higher expression of liver regenerationrelated markers, including hepatocyte growth factor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a lower expression of proapoptotic markers, such as cleaved caspase 3 and Bim in mouse livers, and a lower expression of proinflammatory markers (F4/80 and CD68) compared to the CS injection. HBxIS exhibited higher liver regenerative, antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic properties, particularly in the mouse model of hepatitis B compared to CS. This suggests that the secretome obtained by stimulating ASCs with diseasecausing agents may have a more prominent therapeutic effect on the specific disease than the naive secretome."
Paediatric hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections: An observational study of a Danish cohort.,"AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics in children with either chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Denmark. METHODS: In this observational study, children and adolescents with either chronic HBV or HCV infection followed at the largest paediatric departments in Denmark between 2001 and 2013 were included. Data collection included as well epidemiological data as clinical data like virus genotype, viral load, serological markers, liver biochemistry, liver elastography and histology if available. RESULTS: The study included 131 children. None of the patients had decreased liver function or end-stage liver disease during follow-up. Ten of the 18 children who underwent liver biopsy had signs of fibrosis. Thirteen (11%) children with HBV and one (7%) child with HCV received treatment. Different indications and different treatment regimens were used. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that chronic HBV and HCV infections are often mild diseases during childhood. Nevertheless, children are at higher risk of serious liver disease early in life because of the early time of infection and probably also because of the high viral loads."
Intracellular interferon signalling pathways as potential regulators of covalently closed circular DNA in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.,"Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is still a major global health threat as 250 million people worldwide continue to be chronically infected with the virus. While patients may be treated with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, this only suppresses HBV titre to sub-detection levels without eliminating the persistent HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome. As a result, HBV infection cannot be cured, and the virus reactivates when conditions are favorable. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines known to induce powerful antiviral mechanisms that clear viruses from infected cells. They have been shown to induce cccDNA clearance, but their use in the treatment of HBV infection is limited as HBV-targeting immune cells are exhausted and HBV has evolved multiple mechanisms to evade and suppress IFN signalling. Thus, to fully utilize IFN-mediated intracellular mechanisms to effectively eliminate HBV, instead of direct IFN administration, novel strategies to sustain IFN-mediated anti-cccDNA and antiviral mechanisms need to be developed. This review will consolidate what is known about how IFNs act to achieve its intracellular antiviral effects and highlight the critical interferon-stimulated gene targets and effector mechanisms with potent anti-cccDNA functions. These include cccDNA degradation by APOBECs and cccDNA silencing and transcription repression by epigenetic modifications. In addition, the mechanisms that HBV employs to disrupt IFN signalling will be discussed. Drugs that have been developed or are in the pipeline for components of the IFN signalling pathway and HBV targets that detract IFN signalling mechanisms will also be identified and discussed for utility in the treatment of HBV infections. Together, these will provide useful insights into design strategies that specifically target cccDNA for the eradication of HBV."
Hepatitis b infection: progress in identifying patients most likely to respond to peginterferon alfa.,"Introduction: Despite the disadvantage of side effects, pegylated interferon alpha (Peg-IFN alpha) remains an indispensable agent for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) due to its immunomodulatory effect. The selection of a patient most likely to have a favorable response becomes an essential issue for Peg-IFN alpha therapy.Areas covered: Recent progress in the prediction of the treatment response to Peg-IFN alpha.Expert opinion: Before Peg-IFN alpha therapy, baseline host and viral factors, including female sex, younger age, a high alanine aminotransferase level, HBV genotype A or B, and low viral load, predict a favorable response. In addition, on-treatment viral kinetics of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA help clinicians determine whether to continue or discontinue Peg-IFN alpha therapy. The novel HBV markers hepatitis B core-related antigen and HBV RNA have recently been investigated as useful predictors. The limited efficacy of Peg-IFN alpha monotherapy facilitated the development of new strategies of 'add-on' or 'switch to' Peg-IFN alpha in patients receiving long-term nucleot(s)ide analog treatment, which may lead to an increase in HBeAg and HBsAg loss. In summary, tailored Peg-IFN alpha therapeutic strategies based on predictors extended the landscape for CHB treatment."
Changes in the hepatitis B surface antibody in childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia survivors after treatment with the CCLG-ALL 2008 protocol.,"Antibody levels after hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination may be affected by suppression of the immune system due to cancer therapy. As such, childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) survivors are at risk of HBV infection due to immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy. However, the hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)-seropositive rate of childhood ALL survivors after chemotherapy is unknown, and the need to revaccinate HBsAb-seronegative ALL survivors is not appreciated in China. To assess the changes in HBsAb before and after chemotherapy, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 547 patients treated with the Chinese Children Leukaemia Group (CCLG)-ALL 2008 protocol from 1 April 2008 to 30 August 2019. The results revealed that 416 patients (76.1%) were HBsAb-seropositive at diagnosis, and at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, 177 patients (32.4%) were HBsAb-seropositive and 370 patients (67.6%) were HBsAb-seronegative. Interestingly, 11 patients who were HBsAb-seronegative at diagnosis converted to seropositive at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy. HBsAb titres were decreased after chemotherapy (P < 0.0001). Further, patients with higher HBsAb titres at diagnosis were more likely to maintain protective antibody titres at the completion of chemotherapy (P < 0.0001). The loss of antibody was more remarkable in younger patients (</= 10 years) both at diagnosis (P = 0.009) and at the completion of chemotherapy (P = 0.006). In summary, this study showed that 67.6% of patients were HBsAb-seronegative at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, which indicates that ALL survivors are at high risk of HBV. As a result, HBV revaccination after chemotherapy should be highly valued in ALL survivors."
The optimal timing and management of hepatitis B and C in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer related mortality worldwide, with the most common underlying etiologies being chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. Treatment of these viral hepatidities in the setting of HCC has been debated, and there is increasing study addressing this topic. Patients with advanced HCC of either etiology are unlikely to benefit from antiviral treatments, and futility should be considered prior to starting antiviral therapy. Hepatitis B treatment has demonstrated improved survival, decreased risk of hepatitis B reactivation, and decreased risk of late HCC recurrence. The mainstay treatment of chronic hepatitis B has been nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), and in the setting of HCC, entecavir and tenofovir are preferred given their higher potency and barriers to resistance. Those who were already on a NAs at the time of HCC diagnosis should be continued on them regardless of the HCC management planned. Patients who are suitable candidates to start NAs should start them at the time of HCC diagnosis. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are the first line therapies for hepatitis C. Unlike with hepatitis B, those with HCV-associated HCC are recommended to start treatment 3-6 months after complete treatment of their HCC, given lower rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) with active HCC. There are also controversial concerns about DAAs contributing to a more aggressive HCC phenotype, but data are limited by retrospective studies, and more recent retrospective studies are more reassuring. In transplant candidates, starting DAAs may be deferred until after transplant depending on median regional wait times, availability of HCV positive organs, and the degree of the patient's liver dysfunction. Overall, in patients with HCC from hepatitis B or C, treatment of the underlying viral hepatitis should be considered unless advanced stage limits benefits and results in futility."
Transaminase Elevations during Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B Infection: Safety Considerations and Role in Achieving Functional Cure.,"While current therapies for chronic HBV infection work well to control viremia and stop the progression of liver disease, the preferred outcome of therapy is the restoration of immune control of HBV infection, allowing therapy to be removed while maintaining effective suppression of infection and reversal of liver damage. This ""functional cure"" of chronic HBV infection is characterized by the absence of detectable viremia (HBV DNA) and antigenemia (HBsAg) and normal liver function and is the goal of new therapies in development. Functional cure requires removal of the ability of infected cells in the liver to produce the hepatitis B surface antigen. The increased observation of transaminase elevations with new therapies makes understanding the safety and therapeutic impact of these flares an increasingly important issue. This review examines the factors driving the appearance of transaminase elevations during therapy of chronic HBV infection and the interplay of these factors in assessing the safety and beneficial nature of these flares."
[Effects of anti-liver fibrosis treatment on the occurrence of liver cancer in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis].,"Objective: To investigate the effect of anti-liver fibrosis treatment on the occurrence of liver cancer in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis within three years. Methods: 1,049 cases with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis who were hospitalized in Beijing Ditan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from October 2008 to August 2016 were enrolled. Clinical data were collected, and COX regression analysis was used to find the independent influencing factors for the occurrence of liver cancer in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis within three years. According to whether the patients had received anti-liver fibrosis treatment for >/= 6 months, they were divided into combination and antiviral group. There were 388 cases in combination group and 661 cases in antiviral group. In addition, the combination group received anti-liver fibrosis therapy with Chinese patent medicine on the basis of antivirus, and the antiviral group received antiviral treatment. The incidence of liver cancer within three years were compared between the two groups, and the incidence of liver cancer in patients with different Child-Pugh grades and mPAGE-B risks was further analyzed. The independent samples t-test, Mann Whitney U test, chi2 test or Fisher's exact probability method were used for data comparison. Results: Anti-liver fibrosis treatment was an independent protective factor to prevent liver cancer in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis within 3 years (P < 0.05). The incidence of liver cancer in the combination group was lower than antiviral group within 3 years (10.3% vs. 15.4%, chi (2) = 5.480, P < 0.05). Child-Pugh stratified analysis showed that the risk of liver cancer was significantly reduced in Child-Pugh grade A patients (6.7% vs. 12.6%, chi (2) = 2.857, P = 0.040). Among high-risk patients with mPAGE-B, the incidence of liver cancer was significantly lower in combination group than control group (13.7% vs. 19.9%, chi (2) = 6.671, P = 0.031). Conclusion: Compared to antiviral therapy alone, combined anti-liver fibrosis and antiviral therapy can reduce the liver cancer occurrence risk in patients with hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis for 3 years. Patients with Child-Pugh grade A and high-risk group by mPAGE-B scores are the dominant population to receive treatment."
