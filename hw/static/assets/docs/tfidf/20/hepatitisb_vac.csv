Title,Abstract
Hepatitis B Vaccine,"The hepatitis B vaccine is a medication used in the prevention of hepatitis B infection, which can lead to chronic liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is in the vaccine class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for the hepatitis B vaccine as a valuable agent in the prevention of hepatitis B infection. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other vital factors pertinent for members of the healthcare team in reducing the burden of hepatitis B on their patients and community."
[Hepatitis B vaccine and liver cancer].,"Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) chronic infection contributes to a high risk of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) development. HBV is a strong cancer inducer, due to natural history of infection, virological characteristics and viral DNA integrations events in host genome. Prolonged infection and high viral loads, particularly frequent in patients infected in childhood, are risk factors of HCC development for patients with HBV chronic infection. A HBV vaccine, based on immunization against the surface protein HBs, showed a strong efficacy to prevent chronic HBV infection. The development of universal neonatal vaccination programmes contributed to the decrease of HBV chronic infection incidence in children of high endemic areas. Although HBs antibodies levels diminished years after vaccination, HBV neonatal vaccination programmes led to a lower incidence of chronic HBV infection among young adults. The decrease of HBV chronic infection incidence was associated to a reduction of HCC incidence in children and young adults from areas with a high prevalence of HBV infection."
Heplisav-B: A Hepatitis B Vaccine With a Novel Adjuvant.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the immunogenicity and safety of a hepatitis B vaccine containing the cytosine phosphoguanosine (CpG) 1018 adjuvant (HepB-CpG). DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were performed using PubMed and Scopus with the search terms hepatitis B vaccine, HepB-CpG, CpG 1018, 1018-ISS, HBsAg-1018, HBV-ISS, and Heplisav. Other sources included the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and prescribing information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Search limits included randomized controlled trial in humans and published in English from January 2003 to August 2020. Studies using the final formulation and dosing schedule were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies demonstrated that 2 doses of HepB-CpG induced significantly higher seroprotective responses with a faster onset in adults, including those in hyporesponsive populations, compared with 3 doses of alum-adjuvanted Engerix-B. Although the safety profile was comparable to that of Engerix-B, one study observed higher rates of acute myocardial infarction, herpes zoster, and death with HepB-CpG. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: ACIP recommends use of HepB-CpG as an option to prevent hepatitis B virus infection in adults >/=18 years old. Higher immune responses after 2 doses make it a promising option, especially in those with risk factors for hyporesponsiveness or at risk for poor adherence to vaccine series completion. Additional data are needed regarding the vaccine's safety in the general population and the persistence of its antibody response. CONCLUSION: HepB-CpG has been shown to be as immunogenic as Engerix-B; however, long-term safety and persistence of immune memory has yet to be established."
Vaccine-induced protection against hepatitis B in pediatric solid organ transplant patients.,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has led to a worldwide reduction in disease burden and mortality. Vaccine immunogenicity data in transplanted children are limited, and vaccine-induced protection may be reduced. We evaluated HBV vaccination coverage, seroprotection rates, and factors influencing vaccine immunity among pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) patients. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients </=21 years of age evaluated for SOT and/or transplanted at our center between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018. A detailed chart review was conducted using a standard questionnaire to gather information on demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of patients' HBV vaccination, and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titers. RESULTS: A total of 381 patients undergoing evaluation and/or transplantation were included: 139 (36.5%) liver, 138 (36.2%) kidney, and 104 (27.3%) heart. Overall, HBsAb at evaluation was reactive in 216 (56.7%), indeterminate in 17 (4.5%), non-reactive in 138 (36.2%), and not available in 10 (2.6%). Of those that completed a primary HBV vaccine series (n = 304), HBsAb was reactive in 164 (53.9%), indeterminate in 13 (4.3%), non-reactive in 119 (39.1%), and not available in 8 (2.6%). For those up to date for age on HBV vaccinations with non-reactive/indeterminate titers at evaluation, revaccination and a follow-up HBsAb were available in 45 patients of which 33 (73.3%) seroconverted to a reactive HBsAb titer. CONCLUSION: Vaccine-induced protection against HBV infection among high-risk pediatric SOT recipients can be improved by serology-based intervention. Though the absence of HBsAb does not always indicate loss of protection, boosting or completing primary series is recommended."
Effects of hepatitis B vaccine boosters in different levels of epidemic areas on anti-HBs-negative children after primary vaccination.,"Introduction. The widespread of hepatitis B virus is a severe global public problem, and the infant hepatitis B vaccine has been proved effective. But the failure of the immune response was reported in studies, and boosters were recommended. There were few studies about the effect of hepatitis B vaccine boosters in different levels of the epidemic area.Hypothesis. Booster immunization is recommended because there may be a lack of immunization in infants vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine. In order to verify the effectiveness of booster immunization, this study hypothesized that it worked well in different levels of endemic areas.Aim. To evaluate the effects of hepatitis B vaccine boosters on children from the areas with different prevalence of hepatitis B whose hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) were negative (<10 mIU ml(-1)).Methodology. A total of 940 children were initially enrolled in screening; however, 421 were excluded. The participants were divided into three groups according to the different areas they come from: group I, low epidemic area; group II, middle epidemic area; and group III, high epidemic area. In total, 519 subjects were administered three doses of booster hepatitis B vaccine (0-1-6 months, 10 microg). The antibody titre changes were examined at four time points: 1 month after dose 1, 1 month, 1 year and 5 years after dose 3.Results. The protective seroconversion rates in three groups were 96.30, 97.16, 96.63% at 1 month after dose 1, and 100.00, 100.00, 100.00% at 1 month after dose 3, and 97.79, 100.00, 98.50% at 1 year after dose 3, and 90.77, 93.67, 93.59% at 5 years after dose 3 (P>0.05).Conclusions. This study demonstrates that three doses of booster vaccination have a longtime effect, no matter whether it is in low, middle or high prevalence areas in which subjects live."
"Hepatitis B vaccine coverage and risk factors for lack of vaccination in subjects with HBsAg negative liver cirrhosis in Italy: still, much work should be done.","BACKGROUND: in Italy, Hepatitis-B-vaccine is advised and provided free-of-charge for subjects with chronic liver disease (CLD), including liver cirrhosis. AIMS: to evaluate HB-vaccine-coverage and variables associated with lack of vaccination in cirrhotic patients with particular attention to cirrhosis' etiology. METHODS: cirrhotic patients of any etiology (excluding HBsAg+) referring to 8 tertiary-centers were prospectively enrolled for a-six-months-period in 2019. Subjects were asked if they received HB-vaccine previously. Multiple-logistic-regression-analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of lack of vaccination. RESULTS: 731 cases were recruited. Overall-vaccine-coverage was 16.3% (23.7% in those younger than 65y, 10.0% in those older than 64y; p<0.001). Lack of information was the most frequent reason (78.5% of cases) reported by the 608 unvaccinated subjects, without statistical difference by area-of-birth (77.3% in Italians, 80.0% in people-born-abroad). Age>64 y (OR: 4.27; CI 95%: 2.52-7.24), educational level<9 years (OR: 3.52; CI 95%: 2.10-5.90), residence in South/Sardinia (OR 2.52; CI 95%:1.45-4.39), birth-abroad (OR 5.09; CI 95%: 1.07-24-.17), and Child grade B/C(OR 2.68; CI 95%: 1.35-5.33) all resulted independent predictors of likelihood of lack of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination-rate in cirrhotic patients results very low. Vaccine-coverage implementation in these subjects, is warranted. Vaccine should be provided in early CLD, when immunization is most effective."
Effect of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor on efficacy of adjuvanted recombinant hepatitis B and zoster vaccines.,"Vaccinations are effective in preventing infections; however, it is unknown if patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who are treatment naive (TN) or receiving Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's) respond to novel adjuvanted vaccines. Understanding the effect of BTKi's on humoral immunity is timely because BTKi's are widely used and vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is urgently needed. In 2 open-label, single-arm clinical trials, we measured the effect of BTKi's on de novo immune response against recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HepB-CpG) and recall response against recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in CLL patients who were TN or on BTKi. The primary end point was serologic response to HepB-CpG (anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies >/=10 mIU/mL) and RZV (>/=fourfold increase in anti-glycoprotein E). The response rate to HepB-CpG was lower in patients on BTKi (3.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-18.9) than patients who were TN (28.1%; 95% CI, 15.6-45.4; P = .017). In contrast, the response rate to RZV did not differ significantly between the BTKi (41.5%; 95% CI, 27.8-56.6) and TN cohorts (59.1%; 95% CI, 38.7-76.7; P = .2). BTKi's were associated with a decreased de novo immune response following HepB-CpG, whereas recall immune response following RZV was not significantly affected by BTKi therapy. These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03685708 (Hep-CpG) and #NCT03702231 (RZV)."
CpG-Adjuvanted Hepatitis B Vaccine (HEPLISAV-B(R)) Update.,"Introduction: HEPLISAV-B is a hepatitis B vaccine composed of rHBsAg mixed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing CpG motifs that stimulate innate immunity through TLR9. This vaccine was recently approved by FDA in view of its superior efficacy.Areas covered: Published literature on HEPLISAV-B was critically reviewed. Four randomized controlled trials among 7,056 subjects receiving 2 doses of HEPLISAV-B and 3,214 subjects receiving 3 doses of Engerix-B showed superior seroprotection rate (SPR) (anti-HBs >/=10 mIU/mL) of 90-100%, compared with 71-90% in those receiving Engerix-B. Furthermore, the seroprotection rate was also significantly higher in HEPLISAV-B compared with Engerix-B recipients in persons with traditionally poor vaccine responses such as older adults, diabetics, and those with chronic kidney disease. The safety profiles among 9,871 subjects were similar between HEPLISAV-B and Engerix-B .Expert opinion: HEPLISAV-B, a CpG adjuvant mixed with HBsAg, is more efficacious and produced earlier seroprotection compared to existing vaccines, with a favorable safety profile. The shorter, two-dose regimen, earlier seroprotection, higher adherence, and a higher seroprotection rate, especially in populations with traditionally poor vaccine response, makes this an important therapeutic option in hepatitis B vaccination."
Vaccination against Hepatitis B: A Scoping Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030 as one of the international Sustainable Development Goals puts the hepatitis B vaccination on the forefront. However, barriers to vaccination reported in various studies are of concern. This study explores the global barriers for effective uptake of Hepatitis-B vaccination. METHODS: A scoping review of studies reporting hepatitis B vaccination barriers was done using PMC data base and Google scholar search engine. About 803 journal articles and reports on hepatitis B barriers were retrieved but only 36 most relevant items during last 10 years were identified, pile sorted, grouped and analyze. RESULTS: Overall 74 barriers have been identified for effective uptake of hepatitis-B vaccines. Most studies focused on non-zero dose of hepatitis B vaccine, One-third of the barriers are related to system issues, one-fourth of the barriers were related to caregiver education or awareness, fear of side effect, migration etc., one-fifth barriers were related to service provider issues like poor out-reach, home visits, poor communication and/relation with the caregivers, failure to identify unimmunized children etc., and other barriers were social-cultural issues. The review reveals limited availability and accessibility to health-facility based immunization, lack of awareness among caregivers, poor communication by the healthcare workers and negative relationships with the beneficiaries, cost of vaccine in private sector, inconvenience time and place of vaccination etc. as the major barriers for hepatitis B vaccination. Barriers varied from country to country. CONCLUSION: Myriad barriers for reduced hepatitis-B vaccine uptake need to be addressed contextually as countries are at different stages of hepatitis-B vaccination implementation."
Two-Dose Hepatitis B Vaccine (Heplisav-B) Results in Better Seroconversion Than Three-Dose Vaccine (Engerix-B) in Chronic Liver Disease.,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of the two-dose hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (Heplisav-B((R))) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) is unknown. AIMS: To compare the immunogenicity achieved with Heplisav-B and the conventional three-dose vaccine (Engerix-B((R))) in patients with CLD, and to identify factors that predict seroconversion. METHODS: We retrospectively identified all adults who completed Heplisav-B or Engerix-B regimens from August 1, 2015, to January 31, 2019. Post-vaccination immunity was assessed by quantitative HBV surface antibody (HBsAb) measurement. RESULTS: We identified 166 patients (106 Engerix-B and 60 Heplisav-B) with chronic liver disease (mean age 59.0 +/- 11.3 years, 52% male, 34% cirrhosis, mean MELD score of those with cirrhosis 10.1 +/- 5.4) who had completed the vaccinations and had data available on post-vaccination HBsAb levels at least 2 months after completion of the vaccine regimen. Seroprotective HBsAb levels (> 10 mIU/ml) were achieved in 63% with Heplisav-B and in 45% with Engerix-B (p = 0.03). Univariable analysis showed that age (p = 0.01), insurance (p = 0.02), renal failure (p = 0.02), COPD (p = 0.05), and cirrhosis (p < 0.01) had a significant effect on achieving immunogenicity. On multivariable analysis, patients with cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.55), COPD (aOR: 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.56), or renal failure (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.93) had a lower likelihood of achieving immunity, and patients who received Heplisav-B((R)) had a 2.7-fold greater likelihood of achieving immunity than those who received Engerix-B((R)) (aOR: 2.74, 95% CI 1.31-5.71). CONCLUSION: The two-dose recombinant hepatitis B vaccine resulted in better seroconversion than the three-dose vaccine. Cirrhosis, COPD, and renal failure were associated with a lower likelihood of achieving immunogenicity."
Hepatitis-B Vaccine Response in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Data on efficacy of hepatitis-B vaccine (HBV) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is limited. Our aim was to review the literature and perform meta-analysis of available studies to quantify efficacy of HBV in patients with IBD. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases (inception to July 2020) to identify studies evaluating efficacy of HBV in patients with IBD. Random effects model was used to calculate the pooled rates and I2 percentage values were used to assess the heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies (2375 patients) were included. Four data sets were available from 2 studies that compared HBV response in patients with IBD against healthy controls. The pooled odds ratio of HBV response in IBD patients was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.05-0.33, P = 0.001). The pooled proportion of adequate immune response (AIR) was 64% (95% CI, 55-72.1, P = 0.003) from 13 data sets, and effective immune response (EIR) was 39.7% (95% CI, 30.7-49.5, P = 0.04) from 10 data sets. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD on immunosuppression demonstrated significantly reduced HBV response as compared with general population."
Requirement of a Booster Dose of Hepatitis B Vaccine in Children With Thalassemia After 5 Years of Primary Vaccination: A Prospective Study.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine anti-HBs antibody levels in multi-transfused children with beta-thalassemia major who had received primary hepatitis B vaccination >/=5 years ago, and to document their antibody response to a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine. METHODS: We included 85 children each of beta-thalassemia major and age-matched healthy controls, who had completed primary hepatitis B vaccination >/=5 years ago. Participants were assessed for anti-HBs titres, and those with beta-thalassemia major who were seronegative (titres<10 mIU/mL) were administered a single booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine. CD4 counts, serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-g, and anti-HBs titres were evaluated at baseline and following booster dose of vaccine. RESULTS: Seroprotection rates for hepatitis B after an average (SD) duration of 10.8 (3.8) years of completion of primary immunization were significantly higher among children with beta thalassemia major compared to healthy controls (72.9% vs. 52.9%, P=0.007). All the 23 seronegative children with beta-thalassemia major achieved seroprotection after a single booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: A single booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine after 5 years of primary immunization is adequate to provide seroprotection to multi-transfused children with beta-thalassemia major."
Heplisav-B in Prior Hepatitis B Vaccine Nonresponders: A Case Series.,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis B is a potentially deadly infection that can be acquired by exposure to infectious human blood or body fluids. While service members and others at occupational risk are routinely vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B, non-responders to this vaccine are at continued risk. Heplisav-B is a newer vaccine that may offer additional protection to those at risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of hepatitis B vaccine non-responders who were given Heplisav-B after receiving six or more doses of standard hepatitis B vaccine were collected from existing health records within the military health system after Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board review. RESULTS: Twelve of thirteen (92%) prior non-responders who were tested at least 1 month after completing the recombinant Heplisav-B vaccine series demonstrated seroprotection against hepatitis B. CONCLUSIONS: Ideally, all service members and other at-risk workers should be protected from hepatitis B. This case series suggests that prior non-responders are likely to gain protection from hepatitis B with Heplisav-B vaccination. A prospective trial is warranted for further evaluation of this potential indication."
"Hepatitis B birth vaccination, cohort study, Tunisia 2000-2017.","We aimed to compare the efficiency of the first dose of Hepatitis B (HB) vaccine: at Birth versus at 3 months and to evaluate the efficacy of HB vaccine. We conducted a cohort study in the governorate of Monastir. Vaccinated Cohort (VC) included populations receiving the first dose at 3 months (Protocol 1), and at birth (HepB-BD) (Protocol 2). First dose was followed by at least two doses. We collected, from January 2000 to December 2017, cases diagnosed by serological markers (hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBc). We calculated Absolute Risk (AR) per 100,000 PY and the Relative risk reduction (RRR). Twenty-five cases were notified among VC and 1501 cases among not vaccinated cohort (NVC). Twenty-three cases were notified among the cohort receiving the first dose at 3 months and two cases in Protocol 2. The AR per 100,000 PY was 5.67 (CI95%: 3.36-7.99) in Protocol 1 and 0.11 (CI95%: 0.001-0.26) in Protocol 2. The RRR was 77% (95% CI: 66; 85) in Protocol 1 and 99.4% (95% CI: 97.8; 99.9) in Protocol 2. We identified 4 HB cases for children aged between 5 and 11 who benefited from protocol 1 (born between 2000 and 2006) and zero cases for children of the same age group benefiting from protocol 2 (born between 2011 and 2017). The annual number of HB has decreased from 112 in 2000 to 48 in 2017. We predicted 40 new cases of HB in 2030. HepB-BD was 99.4% effective at preventing HB. The continuity of HepB-BD worldwide would achieve WHO's goal of eliminating HB as a threat to health by 2050.

"Vitamin D and the hepatitis B vaccine response: a prospective cohort study and a randomized, placebo-controlled oral vitamin D3 and simulated sunlight supplementation trial in healthy adults.","PURPOSE: To determine serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D relationship with hepatitis B vaccination (study 1). Then, to investigate the effects on hepatitis B vaccination of achieving vitamin D sufficiency (serum 25(OH)D >/= 50 nmol/L) by a unique comparison of simulated sunlight and oral vitamin D3 supplementation in wintertime (study 2). METHODS: Study 1 involved 447 adults. In study 2, 3 days after the initial hepatitis B vaccination, 119 men received either placebo, simulated sunlight (1.3 x standard-erythema dose, 3 x /week for 4 weeks and then 1 x /week for 8 weeks) or oral vitamin D3 (1000 IU/day for 4 weeks and 400 IU/day for 8 weeks). We measured hepatitis B vaccination efficacy as percentage of responders with anti-hepatitis B surface antigen immunoglobulin G >/= 10 mIU/mL. RESULTS: In study 1, vaccine response was poorer in persons with low vitamin D status (25(OH)D </= 40 vs 41-71 nmol/L mean difference [95% confidence interval] - 15% [- 26, - 3%]; 1,25(OH)2D </= 120 vs >/= 157 pmol/L - 12% [- 24%, - 1%]). Vaccine response was also poorer in winter than summer (- 18% [- 31%, - 3%]), when serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were at seasonal nadirs, and 81% of persons had serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L. In study 2, vitamin D supplementation strategies were similarly effective in achieving vitamin D sufficiency from the winter vitamin D nadir in almost all (~ 95%); however, the supplementation beginning 3 days after the initial vaccination did not effect the vaccine response (vitamin D vs placebo 4% [- 21%, 14%]). CONCLUSION: Low vitamin D status at initial vaccination was associated with poorer hepatitis B vaccine response (study 1); however, vitamin D supplementation commencing 3 days after vaccination (study 2) did not influence the vaccination response.

The Improvement of Immune Effect of Recombinant Human Beta-Defensin 2 on Hepatitis B Vaccine in Mice.,"Immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is an effective measure for prevention and control of hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection. Although lots of efforts to improve the effect of hepatitis B vaccine have been made, the function of human beta defensin 2 (hBD2) on hepatitis B vaccine keeps unclear. In this article, we report that hBD2 not only promoted the activation and maturation of immature dendritic cells (iDCs) by increasing MHC II and CD86 expression, but it also significantly upregulated the mRNA level of IL-6 and IL-12B in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. The serum concentrations of IFN-gamma in mice stimulated with 300 ng hBD2 increased from 25.21 to 42.04 pg/mL, with a time extension from 4 to 12 h post-injection. During the process of three times immunization (1, 14, 28 days) with 3 mug hepatitis B vaccine combined with or without 300 ng hBD2 with a 2 week interval in BALB/c mice, the antibody against HBsAg (HBsAb) concentration in serum at every time point of observation in the combined group was statistically higher than the hepatitis B vaccine group. The serum concentration of IgG2a subclass HBsAb on the 14th day post last injection in the combined group was significantly higher than the hepatitis B vaccine group. Further, the splenic cells from the mice treated with both hBD2 and hepatitis B vaccine possessed a greater ability to produce a surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) specific IFN-gamma than those treated with hepatitis B vaccine alone. The percentages of CD3(+)/CD4(+) T cells and CD3(+)/CD8(+) T lymphocytes in spleens from the mice treated with 300 ng hBD2 were statistically higher than the phosphate buffered saline group. These data suggest that hBD2 improves iDC maturation and the immune efficiency of hepatitis B vaccine in BALB/c mice."
Hepatitis B Vaccination Uptake Rate and Predictors in Healthcare Professionals of Ethiopia.,"Introduction: Healthcare professionals continue to be at risk of acquiring occupation-related hepatitis B virus infection because of noncompliance for the 3-dose primary series of hepatitis B vaccine recommended. The objective of the study was to determine the rate of and to identify the predictors of hepatitis B vaccination uptake in healthcare professionals in Ethiopia. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 19 2018 and June 15 2018. A stratified with systematic random sampling technique was used to select 260 healthcare professionals. A structured questionnaire was used to collect all the necessary primary data from samples. This survey analyzed hepatitis B vaccination uptake as the binary outcome variable (""noncomplete"" vs ""complete"") with regard to the 30 potential predictor variables. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis techniques have been used to address the study objective. Results: The rate of complete vs noncomplete hepatitis B vaccination uptake was 37.7% vs 62.3%. The significantly independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination uptake were professional qualification (P=0.004), professional experience (P=0.013), household income (P=0.006), workload status (P=0.015), routine infant immunization program existence at the workplace (P=0.014), perceived susceptibility to infection (P=0.005), perceived safety of vaccine (P=0.001), prior occupational exposure to blood (P=0.006), training on universal precautions (P=0.015), and colleagues' suggestion (P=0.002). Conclusion: The rate of hepatitis B vaccination uptake found was currently low. The significantly independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination uptake included perceived safety, colleagues' suggestion, professional qualification, perceived susceptibility, household income, prior occupational exposure to blood, professional experience, existence of routine infant immunization program at the workplace facility, workload status, and universal precautions training."
Factors influencing the durability of hepatitis B vaccine responses.,"The World Health Organization recommends the implementation of universal hepatitis B (HB) vaccination, and global coverage for this vaccine reached 84% in 2015. In Japan, the policy aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HB virus (HBV) initially commenced as a specific vaccination program for infants born to mothers who were positive for HB surface antigen. In 2016, universal HB vaccination was implemented in this country to cover unvaccinated individuals at risk of horizontal HBV transmission. Although HB vaccination has been shown to be highly efficacious and safe, the issues of vaccine non-responders and of the loss of antibodies directed against HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) in HB vaccine recipients remain. To gain better insight into these problems, we previously performed an immunological analysis on adult vaccine recipients after they received an initial HB vaccination. We found that the course of successful HB vaccination is composed of the following distinct phases: 1) acquisition of anti-HBs antibody, 2) attainment of high anti-HBs antibody titers, and 3) maintenance of acquired anti-HBs antibody levels. In this review, we describe the significance of HB vaccination and suggest a potential means of improving the impact of HB vaccination based on our immunological analysis."
Hepatitis B Vaccine Non-Responders Show Higher Frequencies of CD24(high)CD38(high) Regulatory B Cells and Lower Levels of IL-10 Expression Compared to Responders.,"Background: The cellular mechanisms involved in the lack of protective antibody response after hepatitis B vaccination are still rather unclear. Regulatory B cells (Breg) known as modulators of B-and T-cell responses may contribute to poor vaccine responsiveness. The current study aimed to investigate the role of regulatory B cells (Breg) in hepatitis B vaccine non-responsiveness after immunization with second- or third-generation hepatitis B vaccines. Method: We performed comparative phenotypic and frequency analysis of Breg subsets (CD24(+)CD27(+) and CD24(high)CD38(high) Breg) in second-generation hepatitis B vaccine non-responders (2(nd) HBvac NR, n = 11) and responders (2(nd) HBvac R, n = 8) before (d0), on day 7 (d7), and 28 (d28) after booster vaccination. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated ex vivo with a combination of CpG, PMA, and Ionomycin (CpG+P/I) and analyzed for numbers and IL-10 expression levels of Breg by flow cytometry-based analyses. Results: Flow cytometry-based analyses revealed elevated frequencies of CD24(+)CD27(+) Breg at all time points and significantly higher frequencies of CD24(high)CD38(high) Breg on d0 (p = 0.004) and 28 (p = 0.012) in 2(nd) HBvac NR compared to 2(nd) HBvac R. In parallel, we observed significantly lower levels of CpG+P/I-induced IL-10 expression levels of CD24(+)CD27(+) and CD24(high)CD38(high) Breg (d0: p < 0.0001; d7: p = 0.0004; d28: p = 0.0003 and d0: p = 0.016; d7: p = 0.016, respectively) in 2(nd) HBvac NR compared to 2(nd) HBvac R before and after booster immunization. Frequencies of CD24(+)CD27(+) and CD24(high)CD38(high) Breg significantly decreased after third-generation hepatitis B booster vaccination (d7: p = 0.014; d28: p = 0.032 and d7: p = 0.045, respectively), whereas IL-10 expression levels of both Breg subsets remained stable. Conclusion: Here we report significantly higher frequencies of CD24(high)CD38(high) Breg in parallel with significantly lower IL-10 expression levels of CD24(+)CD27(+) and CD24(high)CD38(high) Breg in 2(nd) HBvac NR compared to 2(nd) HBvac R. Anti-HBs seroconversion accompanied by a decrease of Breg numbers after booster immunization with a third-generation hepatitis B vaccine could indicate a positive effect of third-generation hepatitis B vaccines on Breg-mediated immunomodulation in hepatitis B vaccine non-responders."
Social and behavioral determinants of attitudes towards and practices of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose in Vietnam.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant public health issue in Vietnam. Our goal was to understand the determinants of attitudes towards and practices of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose (HepB-BD) in certain regions of Vietnam. METHOD: A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted in three geographically diverse provinces that reported low coverage (<50%) of HepB-BD. Using purposive sampling of participants, 29 focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with caregivers (n = 96), healthcare providers (n = 75), and healthcare administrators (n = 16). Summary notes from these were translated, and inductive coding was used to derive themes. The SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix was used as a theoretical framework to organize barriers and facilitators associated with the themes into three levels of influence. RESULTS: At the individual and group level, caregivers who had higher levels of knowledge about HepB-BD sought the vaccine proactively, while others with lower knowledge faced barriers to the vaccine. Some caregivers reported a negative attitude toward health services because of a language barrier or had generalized concerns about HepB-BD due to media reporting of the past adverse events. Distress arising from potential adverse events was equally common among healthcare providers. At the contextual level, the physical environment made it difficult for caregivers to access healthcare facilities and for providers to conduct outreach. Home births posed a challenge for timely administration of HepB-BD, while health facility births facilitated it. Vaccination-specific barriers included misinterpretation of pre-vaccination screening criteria and asking for the consent of caregivers. Inadequate resources for service delivery negatively influenced HepB-BD attitudes and practices. CONCLUSION: Given the diversity of barriers associated with attitudes towards and practices of HepB-BD in the three provinces, tailored interventions will be necessary for both demand- and supply-side factors. Rural areas, often with more home births and geographic barriers, may require focused attention."
Hepatitis B Vaccine Refusal in the Newborn Period.,"Perinatal hepatitis B (HepB) infection is a serious condition in the pediatric population, with up to 90% of exposed infants progressing to chronic infection. The cornerstone of prevention is the birth dose of the HepB vaccine. In 2018, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices updated their guidelines for the birth dose of the HepB vaccine. These new guidelines included a refined timeline on when the HepB vaccine should be given, including for infants born to women with known HepB infection, unknown HepB status, and universal guidelines regardless of maternal HepB status. However, despite these guidelines, up to 25% of infants do not receive the birth dose of HepB vaccine. Individual provider commitment to administration of the vaccine remains fundamental, but institutional policies also have significant influence in ensuring appropriate vaccine administration for infants. [Pediatr Ann. 2021;50(8):e343-e347.]."
Afucosylated IgG characterizes enveloped viral responses and correlates with COVID-19 severity.,"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are crucial for protection against invading pathogens. A highly conserved N-linked glycan within the IgG-Fc tail, which is essential for IgG function, shows variable composition in humans. Afucosylated IgG variants are already used in anticancer therapeutic antibodies for their increased activity through Fc receptors (FcgammaRIIIa). Here, we report that afucosylated IgG (approximately 6% of total IgG in humans) are specifically formed against enveloped viruses but generally not against other antigens. This mediates stronger FcgammaRIIIa responses but also amplifies brewing cytokine storms and immune-mediated pathologies. Critically ill COVID-19 patients, but not those with mild symptoms, had high concentrations of afucosylated IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), amplifying proinflammatory cytokine release and acute phase responses. Thus, antibody glycosylation plays a critical role in immune responses to enveloped viruses, including COVID-19."
Improving adherence to hepatitis B vaccine administration recommendations in two newborn nurseries.,"Administration of the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine is an important step in reducing perinatally acquired hepatitis B infection, yet the USA is below the Healthy People 2020 goal for rate of administration.In response to updated Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices recommendations to administer the dose within 24 hours of birth, we used quality improvement methodology to implement changes that would increase the vaccination rates of healthy newborns in our nurseries. The goal was to improve the proportion of infants who receive the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth to >90% within a 2-year period, with a secondary goal of increasing vaccination rates prior to discharge from the nursery to >95%.Multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were performed. Initial cycles focused on increasing nurse and provider awareness of the updated timing recommendations. Later cycles targeted nursing workflow to facilitate timely administration of the vaccine. We implemented changes at our university medical centre and community hospital newborn nurseries.At the university medical centre nursery, both primary and secondary goals were met; the rate of hepatitis B vaccine administration within 24 hours increased from 81.7% to 96.2%, with vaccine administration prior to discharge increasing from 93.4% to 97.9%. In the community hospital nursery, the baseline rate of hepatitis B vaccine administration within 24 hours was 78.1%, and this increased to 85.8% with the interventions, falling short of the target of >90%. Vaccine administration prior to discharge increased from 87.2% to 92.0%, also not meeting the secondary target of 95%.Interventions that facilitated workflow had additional benefit beyond education alone to improve timing and rates of hepatitis B vaccine administration in both a university medical centre and community hospital nursery."
Hepatitis B vaccine and risk of acute myocardial infarction among individuals with diabetes mellitus.,"PURPOSE: A pre-licensure clinical trial of a two-dose cytosine phosphoguanine adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine (HEPLISAV-B(R) [Dynavax, USA]; HepB-CpG vaccine) found an unanticipated numerical imbalance in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared to recipients of a three-dose aluminum adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine (ENGERIX-B(R) [GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium]; HepB-alum vaccine). A post-licensure study was required to compare AMI rates among recipients of HepB-CpG vaccine and HepB-alum vaccine. Individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM), who are at higher risk of AMI, comprise more than half of the post-licensure study cohort. To inform the ongoing post-licensure study, we examined the association between AMI and receipt of HepB-alum vaccine in individuals with DM. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of individuals with DM ages >/=40 years at Kaiser Permanente Southern California using electronic health records. AMI cases from 2012 to 2017 were identified by principal discharge diagnosis and matched 1:1 with randomly selected controls. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for receipt of >/=1 HepB-alum vaccine dose was compared for AMI cases and controls using conditional logistic regression. We subsequently performed the same matched case-control analysis stratified by year. RESULTS: Of 8138 matched case-control pairs, 17.4% of cases and 15.0% of controls received HepB-alum vaccine. The aOR of HepB-alum vaccination comparing cases and controls was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.87-1.08). Similarly, there was no significant association between HepB-alum vaccine and AMI in any of the study years. CONCLUSIONS: HepB-alum vaccination was not associated with AMI in individuals with DM. This finding will provide contextual insight for the ongoing post-licensure study of HepB-CpG vaccine."
Microneedles with dual release pattern for improved immunological efficacy of Hepatitis B vaccine.,"In this study, dissolving microneedles (DMNs) with dual-release pattern, capable of both bolus release and slow release, were prepared. These DMNs were used with a hepatitis B vaccine that requires multiple shots to achieve immunological efficacy comparable to that obtained when two separate shots are administered. Dissolving microneedles with HBsAg in PLA tips and CMC coating formulation together (HBsAg-PLA/CMC-DMNs) consist of polylactic acid (PLA) tips for slow release, a carboxy-methyl cellulose (CMC) coating formulation for bolus release, and a dissolving base of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for dissolution in the skin. The in vitro release pattern of HBsAg from the CMC coating formulation and PLA tips was observed. Through an in vivo test, 1) the delivery efficiency of HBsAg-PLA/CMC-DMNs was observed, and 2) the immunological efficacy of this method was compared with the efficacy of two shots delivered by conventional intramuscular (IM) administration and two shots delivered by HBsAg-coated microneedle (CMNs) administration. HBsAg-PLA/CMC-DMNs punctured the skin successfully. The PVA/PVP base was completely dissolved within 10 min of insertion, resulting in the delivery of all microneedle tips into the skin. In the in vitro release experiment, all of the HBsAg in the CMC coating formulation was released within 20 min, and the HBsAg present in the PLA tips was gradually released over more than 55 days. The antibody titer of one shot of HBsAg-PLA/CMC-DMNs was the same as or higher than two shots delivered by conventional IM and CMN methods. DMNs with dual-release pattern can deliver two formulations simultaneously with a single shot, resulting in improved immunological efficacy of HBsAg that requires multiple doses. In addition, this dual-release MN system can be used for the delivery of other drugs that require multiple administrations."
Alteration in Hepatitis B Serology in Children Receiving Chemotherapy.,"Chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression can lead to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in cancer patients. Both HBV carriers and individuals with serological signs of previously resolved HBV exposure are under the risk of severe hepatitis and liver failure during and after chemotherapy. The objective of this largest retrospective study was to analyze the consequences of HBV status in children receiving chemotherapy. A total of 479 patients (273 boys and 206 girls) aged 1-211 months diagnosed with acute hematologic malignancies and solid tumors were included in the study. Serological markers for HBV before and after chemotherapy and clinical data of the patients were evaluated retrospectively. Two hundred thirty-four of the participants were found to have protective antibody titers to HBV at admission. Five children were carrying HBV before chemotherapy. They received antiviral therapy during treatment and no reactivation was detected. Antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) remained positive in 194 patients after chemotherapy. However, 17.09% (40/234) lost antiHBs positivity. In this group, three patients (1.28%) who initially had positive antiHBs and antihepatitis B core antibody experienced HBV reactivation and lost their protective antiHBs at the end of the therapy. Median antiHBs titer significantly decreased after chemotherapy (213.14 [range: 24-888] vs. 180.85 [range: 0-850]) (p = 0.0094). The current relatively large trial demonstrated that protective antibody titers remarkably altered after chemotherapy, and at least 17% of the pediatric oncology cases lost antiHBs positivity. Therefore, vaccine prevention and close monitoring of serology should be considered during chemotherapy."
Reduction of the occurrence of occult HBV infection in infants by increasing the dose of hepatitis B vaccine: a large prospective cohort study.,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) has been observed among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers despite successful immunoprophylaxis. This study enrolled 549 infants [349 infants received a 10mug/dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and 200 infants received 20mug/dose HepB] born to HBsAg-positive mothers with HBV DNA load >6log10IU/mL. The anti-HBs levels in the 10mug group were significantly lower than that in the 20mug group both at 7 [652.48 (564.05-754.82) vs. 1541.72 (1268.69-1873.51) mIU/mL, P<0.001] and 12 months old [257.44 (220.29-300.88) vs. 1073.41 (839.27-1372.78) mIU/mL, P<0.001]. The OBI incidence in the 10mug group was significantly higher than that in the 20mug group at both 7 [21.55% (25/116) vs. 7.56% (9/119), P=0.002] and 12 months old [17.07% (14/82) vs. 6.90% (6/87), P=0.041]. OBI incidence in infants with anti-HBs levels <100mIU/mL was higher than that of those with anti-HBs >/=100mIU/mL [35.71% (5/14) vs. 13.12% (29/221), P=0.036]. This study showed that increasing the immunisation dose from 10mug to 20mug significantly improved anti-HBs levels and decreased OBI incidence in infants with a high maternal viral load. We recommend 20mug HepB to treat this high-risk population."
The role of hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose in patients with underlying health conditions.,"We have evaluated the immunological response to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) booster vaccine dose in 129 adults with underlying diseases in comparison with 694 subjects at occupational risk of infection, who have previously completed the primary series and resulted with anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL. After booster dose, 60.5% of the patients with underlying diseases and 14.8% of the subjects at occupational risk resulted seronegative. By comparing two groups, rate of subjects with anamnestic response was higher in at occupational risk group respect to that at risk for medical conditions (OR: 5.99 [95%IC, 3.81-9.41], p < .001). This difference was associated to gender (males/females: OR: 0.619 [95%IC, 0.421-0.910], p = .015) and age (better response for younger people, p = .011)."
Evaluation of hepatitis B vaccine efficacy and factors affecting vaccine nonresponse in patients receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor agents.,"OBJECTIVES: The response rate of patients to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents is quite low. We aimed to assess the efficiency of HBV vaccination in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) receiving anti-TNF agents as well as in healthy controls. We also evaluated the impact of different factors on the efficacy of HBV vaccination. METHODS: Patients with CIDs receiving anti-TNF agents and healthy controls vaccinated for HBV were included in the study during 2018-2019. An adequate immune response and an effective immune response to HBV were defined as >10 IU/L and > 100 IU/L, respectively. RESULTS: Among 274 participants, 187 were patients with CID and 87 were healthy controls. The mean age of the patients with CID (43.9 +/- 11.7 years) was significantly higher than that of the healthy controls (31.4 +/- 7 years) (P = 0.000). Adequate immune response was 60.8 and 94.3% in patients with CID and healthy controls (P = 0.000), respectively, whereas effective immune response was 37.9 and 75.9% (P = 0.000), respectively. In logistic regression analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR), 0.408; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.201-0.830; P = 0.013), use of infliximab (OR, 2.694; 95% CI, 1.203-6.035; P = 0.016) and sertoluzimab (OR, 3.307; 95% CI, 1.287-8.498; P = 0.013), vaccination after anti-TNF treatment (OR, 0.224; 95% CI, 0.083-0.602; P = 0.003) were identified as risk factors of nonresponse to HBV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab and sertoluzimab usage, male sex, and vaccination after anti-TNF treatment were risk factors of nonresponse. HBV vaccination should be given to patients with CID before initiation of anti-TNF treatment and awareness should be spread on this subject."
Assessing the cost-utility of preferentially administering Heplisav-B vaccine to certain populations.,"Vaccination is the primary strategy to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the United States. Prior to 2017, most standard hepatitis B vaccine schedules required 3 doses over 6 months. Heplisav-B, approved in 2017, is administered in 2 doses over a 1 month time period but has a higher per-dose cost ($115.75 per dose compared to $57.25 per Engerix-B dose, costs as of June 1, 2019). We aimed to assess the cost-utility of providing the two-dose Heplisav-B vaccine compared to a three-dose Engerix-B vaccine among adult populations currently recommended for vaccination against hepatitis B. We used a decision-tree model with microsimulation and a Markov disease progression process to assess the cost-utility separately for the following populations: adults with diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, HIV; non-responders to previous hepatitis B vaccination; older adults; and persons who inject drugs (PWID). We modeled epidemiologic outcomes (incident HBV infections, sequelae and related deaths), costs (2019 USD) and benefits (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and compared them across strategies. Sensitivity analyses assessed the cost-utility at varying estimates of Heplisav-B efficacy. In the base case scenario for each population, vaccination with Heplisav-B resulted in fewer HBV infections (37.5-59.8% averted), sequelae, and HBV-related deaths (36.3-71.4% averted). Heplisav-B resulted in decreased costs and increased benefits compared to Engerix-B for all populations except non-responders. Incremental costs from the baseline strategy ranged from $4746.78 saved (PWID) to $14.15 added cost (non-responders). Incremental benefits per person ranged from 0.00005 QALYs (older adults) to 0.7 QALYs (PWID). For persons with HIV and PWID, Heplisav-B resulted in lower costs and increased benefits in all scenarios in which Heplisav-B series efficacy was at least 80%. Vaccination using Heplisav-B is a cost-saving strategy compared to Engerix-B for adults with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and HIV; older adults; and PWID."
How does the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine change over the years in childhood?,"Hepatitis B is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The incidence of HBV infection has significantly decreased with hepatitis B vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccine is administered to children at 0, 1 and 6 months of age according to the national schedule. There is a high rate of protective antibody (anti-HBs) development after hepatitis B vaccination. We conducted the study to investigate how the hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) positivity rates and the titers change over time in childhood following vaccination. Patients who presented at the general pediatric outpatient clinic of Yenimahalle Education and Training Hospital and the HBsAg and anti-HBs titers were tested for any reason between July 2011 and May 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. The cutoff level for protection by the anti-HBs titer was accepted as >/=10 mIU/mL with lower levels indicating no protection. Anti-HBs positivity was compared by age group. Anti-HBs levels were studied in 4326 children. The mean age of the included in the study was 127 +/- 62 months. A protective anti-HBs level (>/=10 mIU/mL) was present in 2292 children (69.2%). The highest anti-HBs antibody positivity rate was in the under 3 years' age group. The positivity rate significantly decreased after age 7 years. The HBsAg level was determined in all children in the study and five had a positive result. In conclusion, our study found that the anti-HBs positivity rate and the anti-HBs level decreased with age. However, the anti-HBs antibody result remained positive in more than half of the children."
Improving Timeliness of Hepatitis B Vaccine Birth Dose Administration.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: When given within 24 hours of birth, the hepatitis B vaccine is up to 90% effective in preventing perinatal infection. The American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends administration within 24 hours for infants with a birth weight >2 kg, but a national benchmark for compliance with this time frame has not been established. We aimed to increase the monthly average of eligible newborns receiving the vaccine on time from 40% to 80% over a 9-month period. METHODS: A series of plan-do-study-act cycles were conducted to improve timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose administration among newborns in the level 1 nursery at our academic community hospital. Interventions included staff education, nurse-driven consent and vaccine ordering, and earlier initial newborn assessments performed by nursing staff. Our primary outcome was the monthly percentage of newborns receiving the vaccine within 24 hours of birth, and our secondary outcome was the frequency of nonvaccination events. Statistical process control was used to analyze the effectiveness of interventions. RESULTS: Our mean monthly rate of vaccine administration within the 24-hour time frame increased from 40% to 92%. Predischarge vaccination rate improved from a mean of 13 to 61 cases between infants discharged without vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led interventions, including the ability to obtain consent and incorporation of the vaccine into our nurse-activated admission order set, were significant contributors to improvement in the timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine administration. We propose a mean of 90% compliance with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations as a benchmark for other institutions."
Immune response to hepatitis B vaccine: An evaluation.,"Background: Hepatitis B virus infection is a major public health problem in India, and all health-care workers (HCWs) need to be immunized to prevent occupational exposure. This study was done to find the hepatitis B vaccination rates, immune response, and predictors of titer <10 mIU/ml among students and HCWs of a tertiary care institution in the state of Kerala. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, Kerala, India, for a period of 1(1/2) years between January 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. Vaccination rates were collected through a screening proforma. Of the 1321 participants who filled the screening proforma, 5 ml of blood was collected aseptically from 579 participants who were fully vaccinated (all the three doses of vaccine) and stored at -20 degrees C until antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) assay was done using Microlisa (Biorad). Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, version 16.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (trial version). Statistical Analysis: Descriptive data were expressed using frequencies and percentages, and Chi-square test was applied to find the association between antibody titer <10 mIU/ml and independent variables. Results: Of the 1321 participants who filled up the screening proforma, the vaccination rate was 72.6%. Majority of the participants, i.e. 83.5% of doctors, 81.1% of nurses, 69.7% of students, and 21.4% of technicians, had taken all the three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Of the fully vaccinated (n = 959) participants, 76.9% had the vaccination during adulthood and only 26.1% had it during childhood. The correlate of protection was defined as the presence of anti-HBs >/=10 mIU/ml. The mean antibody titer was 448 +/- 284.97 mIU/ml ranging from 9.8 to 2000. Of the 579 participants whose titer was checked, 71 (12.3%) had a nonprotective titer of <10 mIU/ml. We found that age >35 (odds ratio [OR]: 3.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.12-6.99]), last dose >10 years (OR: 5.01, 95% CI: 2.94-8.55), no boosters or revaccination (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.42-6.07), and body mass index (BMI) >25 (OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.44-3.39) were associated with nonprotective titer. Conclusion: More than a quarter of the study population who were at high risk of exposure were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Even after taking the full course of hepatitis B vaccine, 12.3% had titer <10 mIU/ml. Nonprotective titer was found to be associated with age >35 years, last dose taken >10 years ago, no boosters/revaccination, and BMI >/=25."
"Assessment of immunogenicity and safety across two manufacturing lots of a 3-antigen hepatitis B vaccine, Sci-B-Vac(R), compared with Engerix-B(R) in healthy Asian adults: A phase 3 randomized clinical trial.","BACKGROUND: Sci-B-Vac(R), a 3-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (3A-HBV), contains all three recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins (S, pre-S1, and pre-S2). In 2005, 3A-HBV manufacturing transferred facilities (A to B), where it continues to be manufactured. METHODS: This phase 3, single-blind, randomized study, conducted at one site in Vietnam, compared efficacy and safety among two 3A-HBV lots, lot A and lot B, and a single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine (1A-HBV), Engerix-B(R). Primary objective was to demonstrate equivalence at day 210 of two 3A-HBV lots in seroprotection rate (SPR; defined as percentage of participants achieving hepatitis B surface antigen antibody [anti-HBs] titers >/= 10 mIU/mL). Secondary objectives were assessing immunogenicity at days 180, 210, and 360, and safety of 3A-HBV. RESULTS: 3A-HBV SPR equivalence was demonstrated at day 210 (lot A: 97.3% [95% CI: 92.4%, 99.4%] vs. lot B: 100.0% [97.0%, 100.0%]). Compared to 1A-HBV, lot B SPR was higher at day 180 (98.3% vs. 81.2%; difference: 17.1% [9.7%, 24.6%]) and non-inferior at day 210 (100% vs. 98.3%; difference: 1.7% [-0.6%, 4.1%]). 3A-HBV lot B showed the same SPR after 2 doses (98.3%) as 1A-HBV after 3 doses (98.3%). Adverse events (AEs) were comparable with both 3A-HBV lots (lot A: 68.7% vs. lot B: 54.2%), but higher than 1A-HBV (35.3%). Vaccination-related AEs included transient injection site pain (38.9%), myalgia (9.3%), and fatigue (7.5%). Eight serious AEs were reported (lot A: 3/134 [2.2%]; lot B: 1/134 [0.8%]; 1A-HBV: 4/133 [2.3%]). One serious AE, syncope, was noted as probably related to study vaccine, lot B. CONCLUSIONS: The two 3A-HBV lots had equivalent immunogenicity, but lot B elicited faster onset of seroprotection and higher anti-HBs titers than both lot A and 1A-HBV in an Asian population. This supports 3A-HBV lot B as an effective choice for HBV vaccination, with a favorable safety profile. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04531098."
Hepatitis B Awareness and Vaccination Patterns among Healthcare Workers in Africa.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination patterns and the understanding of its risks among healthcare workers (HCWs) is a critical step to decrease transmission. However, the depth of this understanding is understudied. We distributed surveys to HCWs in 12 countries in Africa. Surveys had nine multiple-choice questions that assessed HCWs' awareness and understanding of HBV. Participants included consultants, medical trainees, nurses, students, laboratory personnel, and other hospital workers. Surveys were completed anonymously. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis, with a P-value of < 0.05 considered significant; 1,044 surveys were collected from Kenya, Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, and Sierra Leone. Hepatitis B virus serostatus awareness, vaccination rate, and vaccination of HCWs' children were 65%, 61%, and 48%, respectively. Medical trainees had higher serostatus awareness, vaccination rate, and vaccination of their children than HCWs in other occupations (79% versus 62%, P < 0.001; 74% versus 58%, P < 0.001; and 62% versus 45%, P = 0.006, respectively). Cost was cited as the most frequent reason for non-vaccination. West African countries were more aware of their serostatus but less often vaccinated than East African countries (79% versus 59%, P < 0.0001 and 52% versus 60%, P = 0.03, respectively). West African countries cited cost as the reason for non-vaccination more than East African countries (59% versus 40%, P = 0.0003). Our study shows low HBV serostatus awareness and vaccination rate among HCWs in Africa, and reveals gaps in the perception and understanding of HBV prevention that should be addressed to protect HCWs and improve their capacity to control HBV infection."
Immunity to Hepatitis B is Undetectable in the Majority of Adolescents and Young Adults Seeking Outpatient Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess prevalence and predictors of hepatitis B immune status among adolescents and young adults (AYA) seeking outpatient medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective medical chart review was conducted of AYA seeking MOUD between January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria included: diagnosis of opioid use disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition; received hepatitis serologic testing; and no evidence of prior or current hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B immunization initiation was defined as a record of at least 1 hepatitis B vaccination; while receipt of at least 3 vaccinations indicated immunization completion. The presence of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Of the 193 patients that met eligibility criteria, the presence of anti-HBs was evident in 62 (32.1%). Hepatitis B immunization initiation and completion before presenting for MOUD was documented in 102 (52.9%) and 84 (43.5%). In multivariable logistic regression modeling, hepatitis B immunization initiation after infancy was associated with increased odds of having protective anti-HBs relative to immunization series initiation in infancy (OR 8.96, 95% CI 1.57-51.05). Completion of hepatitis B immunization series after infancy as compared to completion in infancy also increased the odds of protective anti-HBs (OR, 6.68, 95% CI 2.10-21.24). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of immunity to hepatitis B were low in AYA seeking MOUD. It is important to immunize patients seeking MOUD for hepatitis B and follow up with checks for seroconversion."
"HBV evolution and genetic variability: Impact on prevention, treatment and development of antivirals.","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) poses a major global health burden with 260 million people being chronically infected and 890,000 dying annually from complications in the course of the infection. HBV is a small enveloped virus with a reverse-transcribed DNA genome that infects hepatocytes and can cause acute and chronic infections of the liver. HBV is endemic in humans and apes representing the prototype member of the viral family Hepadnaviridae and can be divided into 10 genotypes. Hepadnaviruses have been found in all vertebrate classes and constitute an ancient viral family that descended from non-enveloped progenitors more than 360 million years ago. The de novo emergence of the envelope protein gene was accompanied with the liver-tropism and resulted in a tight virus-host association. The oldest HBV genomes so far have been isolated from human remains of the Bronze Age and the Neolithic (~7000 years before present). Despite the remarkable stability of the hepadnaviral genome over geological eras, HBV is able to rapidly evolve within an infected individual under pressure of the immune response or during antiviral treatment. Treatment with currently available antivirals blocking intracellular replication of HBV allows controlling of high viremia and improving liver health during long-term therapy of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but they are not sufficient to cure the disease. New therapy options that cover all HBV genotypes and emerging viral variants will have to be developed soon. In addition to the antiviral treatment of chronically infected patients, continued efforts to expand the global coverage of the currently available HBV vaccine will be one of the key factors for controlling the rising global spread of HBV. Certain improvements of the vaccine (e.g. inclusion of PreS domains) could counteract known problems such as low or no responsiveness of certain risk groups and waning anti-HBs titers leading to occult infections, especially with HBV genotypes E or F. But even with an optimal vaccine and a cure for hepatitis B, global eradication of HBV would be difficult to achieve because of an existing viral reservoir in primates and bats carrying closely related hepadnaviruses with zoonotic potential."
Rapid and high seroprotection rates achieved with a tri-antigenic Hepatitis B vaccine in healthy young adults: Results from a Phase IV study.,"BACKGROUND: Sci-B-Vac(R) is a tri-antigenic recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine (TAV) containing the small (s), medium (pre-S2) and large (pre-S1) hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigens. To comply with vaccine licensure, a new reference standard batch was qualified by characterizing the seroprotection rate (SPR) for anti-HBs titers >/=10 mIU/mL, following vaccination. METHODS: Ninety-one healthy adults aged 20-40 years were enrolled in an open label, single-arm phase IV study receiving three IM doses of 10 mug TAV at 0, 1 and 6 months. Immunogenicity was evaluated monthly and at 7, 9 and 12 months. The primary endpoint to qualify the reference standard was an SPR >/=95% by month 7. Secondary endpoints were proportion of high responders (anti-HBs titers >/=100 mIU/mL) and geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of HBs antibodies each month. Participants were followed for safety to month 12. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was met 2 months after the second dose at month 3 [SPR 98.8%; 95% CI: 93.7%, 99.7%]. Proportion of high responders at months 3 and 7 were 81.4% and 97.6%, respectively. GMC at months 3 and 7 were 413.6 mIU/mL and 6799.9 mIU/mL, respectively. TAV was safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The new reference standard batch of TAV was qualified successfully, demonstrating efficacy, a favorable safety profile and a rapid onset of seroprotection, including after two vaccine doses. Clinical trial registry: NCT04179786."
Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Liver Cancer.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the five leading causes of cancer death in human. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common etiologic agent of HCC in the world. Prevention is the best way to control cancer. There are three levels of liver cancer prevention, i.e., primary prevention by HBV vaccination targeting the general population starting from birth dose, secondary prevention by antiviral agent for high-risk subjects with chronic HBV infection, and tertiary prevention by antiviral agent to prevent recurrence for patients who have been successfully treated for liver cancer. Primary prevention by hepatitis B vaccination is most cost effective, the cancer preventive efficacy support it as the first successful example of cancer preventive vaccine in human. Addition of hepatitis B immunoglobulin immediately after birth and antiviral agent during the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission of HBV are existing or possible emerging strategies to enhance the prevention efficacy of HBV infection and its related liver cancer. Secondary prevention with current antiviral agents may reduce the risk or delay the onset of HCC development, but could not eradicate HBV infection and HCC. Better antiviral therapeutic agents are needed for better secondary prevention."
Lamivudine,"Lamivudine has been well studied in HIV-positive nursing mothers and appears to be well tolerated by their breastfed infants. It has not been studied in HIV-negative nursing mothers being treated for hepatitis B infection, but the low doses used would not be expected to cause any serious adverse effects in breastfed infants. The manufacturer estimates that a breastfed infant's dose would be about 6% of the infant dose for children over 2 years of age. An expert review of available data concluded that there is currently no justification for contraindicating the use of lamivudine for hepatitis B therapy during breastfeeding.[1] Some professional organization guidelines allow breastfeeding during lamivudine therapy, although one guideline cautions against it because of a lack of long-term safety data.[2-4] The lack of long-term safety data with long-term, low-level infant exposure should be discussed with the mother.[2] No differences exist in infection rates between breast-fed and formula-fed infants born to hepatitis B-infected women, as long as the infant receives hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Mothers with hepatitis B are encouraged to breastfeed their infants after their infants receive these preventative measures.[5,6]"
Serological response with Heplisav-B(R) in prior Hepatitis B vaccine non-responders living with HIV.,"BACKGROUND: As people living with HIV (PLWH) are at risk for contracting Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), they should be screened for HBV and vaccinated if not immune. Seroconversion rates in PLWH receiving traditional recombinant HBV vaccines (Engerix-B(R) and Recombivax-HB(R)) have historically been low with at most 70% achieving immunity. In 2017, a recombinant, adjuvanted HBV vaccine (Heplisav-B(R)) was approved for use in HIV-negative patients. Heplisav-B(R) has shown superior seroprotection in this population compared to Engerix-B(R) and Recombivax-HB(R), as well as interim analysis showing higher seropositivity rates in patients undergoing dialysis. However, its efficacy in PLWH is currently unknown. This study evaluates the rate of seroconversion following Heplisav-B(R) administration in PLWH with previous HBV vaccination failure. METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study at The Brooklyn Hospital Center's HIV primary care clinic in Brooklyn, NY. HIV-positive adults who received at least two doses of Heplisav-B(R) and had previously failed to seroconvert after vaccination with Engerix-B(R) or Recombivax-HB(R) were included. The primary outcome is the percentage of PLWH who became seropositive following Heplisav-B(R). RESULTS: A total of 67 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five (37.3%) PLWH had failed at least 2 courses of recombinant vaccines. Fifty-eight (86.6%) PLWH became seropositive (Anti-HBs > 10 mIU/mL) at least two months after completing Heplisav-B(R). For the 9 (13.4%) patients that did not develop immunity, 3 (33%) had a detectable HIV RNA and 3 (33%) had a CD4 count < 200 cells/uL(3). CONCLUSIONS: Heplisav-B(R) was highly effective in achieving immunity to HBV in PLWH who failed non-adjuvanted recombinant vaccines."
Engineered therapeutic nanovaccine against chronic hepatitis B virus infection.,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB), caused by persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, significantly increases the risk of leading to liver diseases. Despite the successful development and implementation of HBV prophylactic vaccines for several decades, the development of therapeutic vaccine, a substantially potential strategy to eradicate HBV and achieve CHB cure, remains a great challenge. Herein, we applied flash nanocomplexation (FNC) technology to prepare nanovaccines with narrow size distribution and high encapsulation via the charge complexation between chitosan and heparin to encapsulate recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen (rHBsAg) or core antigen (rHBcAg), with CpG as adjuvant. The two nanovaccines enhanced the uptake of antigen and adjuvant into Raw264.7 cells and their co-administration further promoted maturation and activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Meanwhile, they exhibited excellent lymph nodes (LNs) targeting ability, draining to proximal and distal LNs with prolonged retention time, following subcutaneous injection. Co-administered nanovaccines could break immune tolerance and restore HBV-specific immune responses. In a mouse model of CHB, 90% and 80% of mice achieved hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance and hepatitis B virus surface antibody (HBsAb) seroconversion, respectively. Moreover, the vaccines induced long-term immune memory in HBV-cured mice to protect them from HBV reinfection. Thus, this work offers a promising and translational alternative for therapeutic CHB vaccine."
"The effects of increased dose of hepatitis B vaccine on mother-to-child transmission and immune response for infants born to mothers with chronic hepatitis B infection: a prospective, multicenter, large-sample cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Appropriate passive-active immunoprophylaxis effectively reduces mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the immunoprophylaxis failure was still more than 5% under the current strategy. The study objective was to investigate the effects of high dose of HB vaccine on MTCT and immune response for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers. METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, large-sample cohort study in four sites of China, and 955 pairs of HBsAg-positive mothers and their infants were enrolled in our investigation. The infants were given 10 mug or 20 mug HB vaccine (at age 0, 1, and 6 months) plus HB immunoglobulin (at age 0 and 1 month). Serum HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and/or HBV DNA levels in the infants were determined at age 12 months. The safety of 20 mug HB vaccine was evaluated by adverse events and observing the growth indexes of infants. RESULTS: Thirteen of 955 infants were HBsAg-positive at 12 months. Stratification analysis showed that immunoprophylaxis failure rates in the 20 mug group were not significantly different from the 10 mug group, whatever maternal HBV load was high or not. But the high dose of HB vaccine significantly reduced low-response rate (anti-HBs 10-100 IU/L) (P = 0.002) and middle-response rate (anti-HBs 100-1000 IU/L) (P = 0.022) and improved high-response rate (anti-HBs >/= 1000 IU/L) (P < 0.0001) in infants born to mothers with HBV DNA < 5 log10 IU/mL. For infants born to mothers with HBV DNA >/= 5 log10 IU/mL, 20 mug HB vaccine did not present these above response advantages. The 20 mug HB vaccine showed good safety for infants. CONCLUSIONS: The 20 mug HB vaccine did not further reduce immunoprophylaxis failure of infants from HBsAg-positive mothers, but increased the high-response and decreased low-response rates for infants born to mothers with HBV DNA < 5 log10 IU/mL.

Hepatitis B Vaccines.,"Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects the liver and may lead to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV represents a worldwide public health problem, causing major morbidity and mortality. Affordable, safe, and effective, hepatitis B vaccines are the best tools we have to control and prevent hepatitis B. In 2019, coverage of 3 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine reached 85% worldwide compared to around 30% in 2000. The effective implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs has resulted in a substantial decrease in the HBV carrier rate and hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality. This article summarizes the great triumphs of the hepatitis B vaccine, the first anticancer and virus-like-particle-based vaccine. In addition, existing unresolved issues and future perspectives on hepatitis B vaccination required for global prevention of HBV infection are discussed."
Comparative cost-effectiveness of a 2-dose versus 3-dose vaccine for hepatitis B prevention in selected adult populations.,"The hepatitis B virus is highly infectious and can cause incurable liver disease, leading to high morbidity rates, increased healthcare utilization, and high mortality. Multiple preventative hepatitis B vaccine options have been available for decades, but adherence to the traditional 6-month vaccine schedule for the approved 3-dose series remains low in adult populations at risk of hepatitis B exposure. A 2-dose hepatitis B vaccine (HEPLISAV-B) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 induces rapid seroprotection within 1 month and has a safety profile comparable to a commonly used 3-dose vaccine. In a previous cost-effectiveness study, HEPLISAV-B had a favorable cost-effectiveness profile for multiple at-risk populations. The goal of the current analysis was to update and extend previous findings by evaluating cost-effectiveness of HEPLISAV-B compared with a 3-dose vaccine (Engerix-B) in selected adult populations, including patients with diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, healthcare personnel, travelers to countries with endemic hepatitis B, and a public health population. Cost-effectiveness was measured as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using a health economics Markov model that accounts for adherence rates, seroprotection rates, healthcare costs, and current pricing considerations. Patients progressed between a series of health states, and the difference in lifetime spending and survival for individuals receiving either HEPLISAV-B or Engerix-B was estimated from the perspective of a US managed care payer, HEPLISAV-B had favorable cost-effectiveness profiles for patients with diabetes, healthcare personnel, travelers, and patients with chronic liver disease and dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis supported the robustness of the cost-effectiveness profiles, and an additional analysis indicated that HEPLISAV-B was cost-effective in the general adult population. Overall, HEPLISAV-B was cost-effective in multiple adult populations recommended for HBV vaccination in the United States."
Tenofovir,"Tenofovir is available in the U.S. in two forms, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and tenofovir alafenamide. Both release tenofovir, but tenofovir disoproxil fumarate releases tenofovir in the bloodstream whereas tenofovir alafenamide enters cells before releasing tenofovir. Most published experience is with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV therapy and prophylaxis. Exposure of the breastfed infant to tenofovir is trivial in HIV-positive mothers and HIV-negative mothers treated for HIV prophylaxis or hepatitis B infection.[1] Some data indicate that tenofovir milk levels decrease with time after delivery. Among HIV-positive mothers who have breastfed during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy no infant adverse effects have occurred up to 2 years of age. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens containing tenofovir are acceptable for use in HIV-negative nursing mothers.[2] Maternal use of prophylactic vaginal tenofovir (investigational in the U.S.) also does not appear to present a risk to the breastfed infant.[3] In hepatitis B, expert reviews of available data and most professional guidelines state that there is no justification for contraindicating the use of tenofovir during breastfeeding.[4-8] One guideline suggests discussing the lack of long-term safety data with the mother.[7] No differences exist in infection rates between breastfed and formula-fed infants born to hepatitis B-infected women, as long as the infant receives hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine at birth."
Immunogenicity and Safety of a 3-Antigen Hepatitis B Vaccine vs a Single-Antigen Hepatitis B Vaccine: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Importance: There is a need for improved immunogenicity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines among young adults with risk of infection. Objectives: To demonstrate manufacturing equivalence of a 3-antigen (3A) HBV vaccine, evaluate noninferiority of seroprotection rate (SPR) of 3A-HBV vs single-antigen (1A) HBV after 2 and 3 vaccine doses, and compare safety and reactogenicity between 3A-HBV and 1A-HBV vaccines. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 3, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial included healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years randomized to 1 of three 3A-HBV groups or 1 control group receiving 1A-HBV. The trial was conducted at 37 community clinics and academic hospitals in Canada, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States between December 2017 and October 2019. Participants were followed up for 48 weeks after the first vaccination. Interventions: Intramuscular administration of 3A-HBV (10 mug) or 1A-HBV (20 mug) on days 0, 28, and 168. Main Outcomes and Measures: Geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serum hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) and proportion of participants achieving seroprotection. Results: Of 2838 participants, 1638 (57.8%) were women, 2595 (91.5%) were White, and 161 (5.7%) were Black or African American. A total of 712 participants (25.1%) were randomized to the 1A-HBV group and 2126 (74.9%) to 3A-HBV. The mean (SD) age at informed consent was 33.5 (8.0) years. The study demonstrated 3A-HBV lot-to-lot consistency, as the 2-sided 95% CIs for each pairwise comparison for the anti-HBs GMC ratios were within 0.67 and 1.50 (eg, adjusted GMC ratio, lot A vs lot B: 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.00; lot A vs lot C: 0.95; 95% CI, 0.78-1.15; lot B vs lot C: 1.16; 95% CI, 0.95-1.41). The SPR of the pooled 3A-HBV was noninferior to 1A-HBV and higher than 1A-HBV after 2 vaccinations at day 168 (90.4% [95% CI, 89.0%-91.8%] vs 51.6% [95% CI, 47.5%-55.6%]) and 3 vaccinations at day 196 (99.3% [95% CI, 98.7%-99.6%] vs 94.8% [95% CI, 92.7%-96.4%]). The mean GMC of anti-HBs with 3A-HBV was 7.9 times higher after 2 vaccinations at day 168 and 3.5 times higher after 3 vaccinations at day 196 compared with 1A-HBV (after 2 vaccinations, 3A-HBV: GMC, 118.7 mIU/mL; 95% CI, 108.0-129.0 mIU/mL; SE, 1.0 mIU/mL; 1A-HBV: GMC, 15.0 mIU/mL; 95% CI, 12.9-17.5 mIU/mL; SE, 1.0 mIU/mL; after 3 vaccinations, 3A-HBV: GMC, 5442.4 mIU/mL; 95% CI, 4967.0-5963.0 mIU/mL; SE, 1.0 mIU/mL; 1A-HBV: 1567.2 mIU/mL; 95% CI, 1338.0-1834.0 mIU/mL; SE, 1.0 mIU/mL). Rates of local and systemic reactogenicities were higher with 3A-HBV compared with 1A-HBV (local: 1805 of 2124 [85.0%] vs 469 of 712 [65.9%]; systemic: 1445 [68.0%] vs 428 [60.1%]). Vaccine discontinuation due to adverse events (AE) was uncommon, and serious AEs were infrequent, reported in 42 participants (2.0%) and 3 participants (0.4%) in the 3A-HBV and 1A-HBV groups, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, consistently higher antibody concentrations and SPRs were found with 3A-HBV after 2 and 3 doses vs 1A-HBV in adults aged 18 to 45 years old. The safety and efficacy of 3A-HBV shows its usefulness for the prevention of hepatitis B in young healthy adults.

Immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine among HIV-infected adults in Uganda.,"BACKGROUND: Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and can rapidly progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent data demonstrate ongoing HBV transmission among HIV-infected adults in SSA, suggesting that complications of HIV/HBV co-infection could be prevented with HBV vaccination. Because HBV vaccine efficacy is poorly understood among HIV-infected persons in SSA, we sought to characterize the humoral response to the HBV vaccine in HIV-seropositive Ugandan adults. METHODS: We enrolled HIV-infected adults in Kampala, Uganda without serologic evidence of prior HBV infection. Three HBV vaccine doses were administered at 0, 1 and 6 months. Anti-HBs levels were measured 4 weeks after the third vaccine dose. ""Response"" to vaccination was defined as anti-HBs levels >/= 10 IU/L and ""high response"" as >/= 100 IU/L. Regression analysis was used to determine predictors of response. RESULTS: Of 251 HIV-positive adults screened, 132 (53%) had no prior HBV infection or immunity and were enrolled. Most participants were women [89 (67%)]; median (IQR) age was 32 years (27-41), and 68 (52%) had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for > 3 months. Median (IQR) CD4 count was 426 (261-583), and 64 (94%) of the 68 receiving ART had undetectable plasma HIV RNA. Overall, 117 (92%) participants seroconverted to the vaccine (anti-HBs >/= 10 IU/L), with 109 (86%) participants having high-level response (anti-HBs >/= 100 IU/L). In multivariate analysis, only baseline CD4 > 200 cells/mm3 was associated with response [OR = 6.97 (1.34-34.71), p = 0.02] and high-level response [OR = 4.25 (1.15-15.69)], p = 0.03]. CONCLUSION: HBV vaccination was effective in eliciting a protective humoral response, particularly among those with higher CD4 counts. Half of the screened patients did not have immunity to HBV infection, suggesting a large at-risk population for HBV infection among HIV-positive adults in Uganda. Our findings support including HBV vaccination as part of routine care among HIV-positive adults."
[Immunization effect and persistence of hepatitis B vaccine in HIV-infected patients with different CD4(+)T cell levels].,"Objective: To explore the immunogenicity and persistence of hepatitis B vaccine in HIV-infected patients with different CD4(+)T cell (CD4) levels, and analyze the influence effect of CD4 levels on immunization response. Methods: A total of 182 HIV-infected patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial of 20 microg and 60 microg hepatitis B vaccination at month 0, 1, and 6 in 2014 by Guangxi Zhuang Atonomous Region CDC and Ningming county CDC were surveyed. Six months later after the first dose and 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years later after the full course of the vaccination, 5 ml of the venous blood of the patients was collected, and the anti-HBs was detected by Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). On the basis of previous studies, this study focused on analyzing the immunogenicity and persistence of hepatitis B vaccine under different CD4 levels. Results: One month later after the whole course of hepatitis B vaccination, the anti-HBs geometric mean concentration (GMC), anti-HBs positive rate (>/=10 mIU/ml) and strong positive rate (>/=100 mIU/ml) in HIV patients with CD4 <350 cells/microl were 442.50 mIU/ml, 71.05% (27/38) and 44.74% (17/38), respectively, which were significantly lower than those HIV-infected patients with CD4 >/=350 cells/microl [583.90 mIU/ml, 92.13% (117/127) and 77.95% (99/127)] (P<0.05). After controlling the confounding factors, the probability of being anti-HBs positive induced by hepatitis B vaccine in patients with CD4 <350 cells/microl was 0.14 times higher than in those with CD4>/=350 cells/microl (95%CI: 0.03-0.62), and patients with CD4 <350 cells/microl had higher risk of no response. From 6 months to 3 years after the whole course of the vaccination, the anti-HBs GMC (195.00-27.55 mIU/ml vs. 300.10-45.81 mIU/ml), the positive rate (56.67%-36.67% vs. 78.57%- 51.58%) and the strong positive rate (33.33%-6.67% vs.44.64%-15.79%) in patients with CD4 <350 cells/microl gradually declined, lower than the levels in those with CD4 >/=350 cells/microl. Conclusions: HIV-infected patients with CD4 <350 cells/microl have high risk of no response to hepatitis B vaccination and poor immune persistence. It is necessary to strengthen the anti-HBs monitoring in HIV-infected patients, with special attention to those with CD4 <350 cells/microl. When anti-HBs is negative, hepatitis B vaccine should be injected as early as possible."
Hepatitis B virus infection among Nigerian pediatric population.,"Hepatitis B infection has continued to be a growing global health concern in spite of the discovery and administration of hepatitis B vaccines over the years. The focus of this study was to evaluate the burden of this infection among asymptomatic pediatric population. Children, who visited the hospital between March and August 2018, were recruited into this study. Blood samples were collected after obtaining informed consent. The samples were processed and screened for HBsAg. Data were analyzed using chi-square statistic. Six (2.9%) of the 206 children in the study were positive for HBsAg. A hundred (48.5%) of the children were males and 106 (51.5%) were females in the ratio 1:1.1 (male to female). More male tested positive (4%) (4/96) than their female counterparts (1.9%) (2/104)(x(2) = 0.813; p = .367). Age group 13-18 years had the highest infection rate 6.6% (4/57), followed by age group 5-12 years with 3.8% (2/50). No HBV detection was recorded among those below the age of 5 years. Patients with no vaccination history had a higher HBV infection rate (4.2%) compared with those who had been vaccinated (1.1%) (x(2) = 1.164; p = .281). The study showed that HBV infection is of intermediate endemicity among the study population, a reflection of the endemic status of the infection in Nigeria. Vaccination effort among children should be sustained and intensified. We advocate for a more intensive public enlightenment on the infection especially among women of marriageable age."
